{"Title": "[Comedy] How to piss off everyone you've ever met so badly that they can't even be bothered to insult you: the roast of Chevy Chase", "Author": "EquivalentInflation", "Subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "Body": "Today, we're going to dive into a forgotten corner of TV and comedy history. In 2002, Chevy Chase was roasted for the second time in the Friar's Club. Despite being largely forgotten, this event would have *massive* ripple effects. If you've ever watched a roast in the past two decades, especially on Comedy Central, chances are you've seen those ripples. Not to mention, the roast was enough to make Chase break down in tears, and reconsider his entire life. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  We'll get to the roast in good time. But to understand what happened there, it's important to understand *why* all of it happened (and on the plus side, there's a whole lot of tasty side drama in the comedy world). First, we have to answer the question \"Who is Chevy Chase\"?\n\n# I'm Chevy Chase, who the hell are you?\n\nBorn in 1947, Chevy Chase is a world renowned American comedian. Well, maybe not world renowned, but at least famous in America. Maybe not famous per se, but at least still decently well known. You've seen him in something. Probably.\n\nChase started his career like many comedians, running around and trying everything he could. Writing satirical articles, founding a comedy ensemble, working for a satirical radio show, etc. Finally, his work paid off. He became a writer for a show called \"Not Ready For Prime Time Players\", better known by its later title: Saturday Night Live.\n\n**Because a sudden rise to fame has never gone to anyone's head.**\n\nShortly before the show first aired, Chase was added to the cast, and joined rehearsals. This became his big break, putting him squarely in the spotlight. He introduced every show but two, and was the anchor for Weekend Update, one of the show's longest running bits. His catchphrase \"I'm Chevy Chase, and you're not\" became extremely famous. He even claimed that his Weekend Update style was the direct inspiration for later comedy news programs like the Daily Show. During the show's run, Chase won two Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for his work on the show, and many have argued since that he [\"defined the franchise\"](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/saturday-night-live-all-145-cast-members-ranked-146340/10-chevy-chase-167162/). Chase was a hit at the time, and was shortlisted by many as one of the funniest rising comedians in America. Someone even suggested that Chase could be the only person to replace the beloved Johnny Carson (although Carson disliked Chase, and replied that \"He couldn't ad-lib a fart after a baked bean dinner\").\n\n**Live from New York, it's literally anyone** ***but*** **Chevy Chase!**\n\nChevy left SNL a few episodes into the second season, the reason for which is still unclear. Chase 's official story claims that his girlfriend didn't want to move out to New York, so he decided to move out to LA and marry her. That story is somewhat backed up by the fact that he'd negotiated out of most of season 2 in his contract with NBC, surprising producer Lorne Michaels (who hadn't been informed). However, there's still suspicion surrounding the episodes he *was* in. Supposedly, he injured his groin doing a pratfall in the first episode, forcing him to be hospitalized for the next two episodes. However, as eagle eyed fans noticed, the \"injured\" Chase was very clearly seen at the end of the first episode dancing around without any issue. Many have theorized that the episodes were a test run, to see if the show could work without Chevy, in anticipation of him leaving. Years later, an anonymous SNL cast member mentioned that he only used his engagement as an excuse to pin it on his (now ex) wife. In reality, he'd left the show purely out of a desire to make more money.\n\nBut why would the show want to see one of it's most popular actors gone? Well, as it would later come out, Chase was a *massive* pain to work with. Egotistical, cruel, and petty, he burned a *lot* of bridges with his fellow cast members, as well as producer Lorne Michaels. When he returned to host in Season 3, Chase reported the atmosphere felt \"poisoned\" against him, and he certainly didn't help himself by ordering people around, and trying to reclaim his spot on Weekend Update, all while using a frankly terrifying amount of drugs. Bill Murray (Chase's replacement) was antagonistic towards him, telling Chase frankly that no one there liked him, leading to a shouting match. Murray then told Chase \"Go fuck your wife, she needs it\" (Chase was having public marriage issues at the time). All of this culminated into Chase hunting Murray down minutes before the show, and challenging him to a fight. If you look closely at Chase's monologue, you can see some marks on his face from where Murray hit him. Chase would go on to host eight more times, racking up more and more problems every time. He'd harass female writers, make cruel jokes (like telling an openly gay cast member he should do a sketch about dying from AIDs) and generally just be a jackass to everyone involved. This came to a head in 1997, when he slapped Cheri Oteri hard in the back of the head, causing a furious Will Ferrell to bring the issue to Lorne Michaels, who banned Chase from the show. Chase was the 12th person to be banned from SNL, and the only former cast member to ever be banned from hosting. Although he's made a few guest appearances on SNL since, they're kept few and far between, and the hosting ban has been enforced.\n\n**You win some, you lose thirty or forty others.**\n\nChase would initially find success striking out on his own, starring in a number of classic comedies like [Caddyshack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddyshack) (alongside Bill Murray funny enough), [Three Amigos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Amigos), [National Lampoon's Vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Vacation), and [National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation). However, Chase's success wasn't for long. He has been in a total of [62 different movies and TV shows](https://www.throughtheclutter.com/cornelius-crane-chase-1039.php), most of which are... they're bad. There's just no other way to put it. He milked National Lampoon's Vacation for *six total movies*, with the quality going downhill each time. He also tried to launch his own celebrity talk show, which bombed and was cancelled just four weeks in. His most recent movie in 2021 was [Panda vs Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_vs._Aliens), which is... I mean, it's exactly what you'd expect. After Chase's initial success, he made bomb after box office bomb, with the failures seriously damaging his ego. He'd reportedly talked a lot of shit at SNL about how everyone else had no chance at a career, so seeing his former castmates all become more famous than him had to sting.\n\nChase's one big hit later in life was [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)), a show where he played a self centered egotistical old man with some seriously dated views. It's like the role was made for him. Members of the cast have been frank about how they only got a celebrity like Chase for such an unknown show was because of how far Chase had fallen, and as the show turned into a surprise hit, it seemed like it might be his ticket back to the top. However, Chase had serious issues on set. His toxic behavior continued, and he had serious issues with director Dan Harmon. At one point, he even refused to do a pivotal scene on the last day of filming, which required scrapping the entire scene. Harmon then made fun of Chase at the wrap party, playing some of the angry voicemails Chase had left him. Chase then left [another angry voicemail](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/memo__120331184343.mp3), which Harmon played at a live event. Eventually, Chase was forced to leave the show after yelling the N-word during a heated argument on set. Later, costar Donald Glover would confirm that Chase [would make frequent racial jokes or insults between scenes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you), trying to get Glover to crack or perform poorly.\n\n**The** **~~best~~** **worst hits**\n\nThe behavior that cost Chevy both SNL and Community was present throughout his entire career (and frankly, his personal life too). It'd take too long to go through every single instance, but some include:\n\n* Chris Columbus quit directing National Lampoon's Vacation before a single day of filming, because he had one dinner with Chevy where he was \"treated like dirt\".\n* On the cast of Community, he told a female cast member \"I want to kill you and rape you\".\n* His wife Jacqueline Carlin divorced him after just over a year, due to him making violent threats against her\n* During a stunt in Three Amigos, Chase made a joke about director John Landis's lax safety precautions after his last film. The film in question? The Twilight Zone, where a stunt gone wrong killed a man and two children.\n* Kevin Smith met with him to discuss relaunching the popular Fletch series, where Chevy \"went on to claim he invented every funny thing that ever happened in the history of not just comedy, but also the known world\". That one lunch ended any possibility of the series.\n* Rob Huebel, a fan of Chase's approached him backstage to shake his hand, upon which Chase slapped him hard across the face\n* Yvette Nicole Brown was asked who she would kick off of Community if she could, and answered with \"Chevy Chase\" before the interviewer even finished the question. She, along with Glover, has noted Chase's stream of racism towards them even before yelling the N-word.\n\n**TL;DR: Chase is known for being incredibly difficult to work with, making cruel, insensitive, and bigoted comments towards those around him. Combined with a massive ego, and a career that tanked just a few years after it took off, Chase has a lot of issues both personally and professionally.**\n\n# Just a bit more backstory, I promise.\n\nBefore we get to the big event, there's just two important pieces of the story left: The Friar's club itself, and Chase's first roast.\n\n**What is the Friar's Club?**\n\nThe Friar's club is a 118 year old New York club whose membership includes some of the best known American comedians of all time, along with a number of other celebrities. There's too many to list, but [reading through their members](https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-new-york-friars-club-members/user-x), it was harder to find a famous person in entertainment that *wasn't* one of them than to find one who was. It's gone a bit downhill in recent years, but at the time, it still had a massive cultural impact. They also essentially invented what we now know as the roast, starting it as an in-house tradition in 1950, which they would later record and air on Comedy Central. The tagline was always \"We only roast the ones we love\", and you had to be a member to participate in the roast (as well as usually being a good friend of the roastee). Their [list of roasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Friars_Club) includes some truly iconic names, all of whom were trashed by some of the best comedians of the era. And also Chevy Chase.\n\nIn 1998, Comedy Central signed a contract with the Friar's club to air their roasts. Now, the jokes and insults were no longer the subject of speculation and gossip, known only by the elite few who could witness it, *everybody* got to see the roast. This also marked a shift from some of the more classic comedic roasts to more modern content: swearing, sex jokes, etc. Once again, the Friar's club sent out ripples that would shape the future of comedy.\n\n**The first roast**\n\nChase had been roasted once before in 1990, and apparently enjoyed the experience. The roastmaster was Dan Akroyd, with Clint Eastwood, Neil Simon, Larry King, Robin Leach, Richard Lewis, Gilbert Gottfried, Rita Rudner, Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller and Lorne Michaels doing the roasting. The guests and audience included many of his close friends (along with celebrities like Rober DeNiro and Richard Pryor), who poked fun at Chase and his career. There's no recording of it, but reportedly, Chase's enjoyment of the experience was why he would agree to come back a second time.\n\nAt this point, Chevy was still 100% a douchebag, but his douchiness hadn't peaked yet, and his career was still looking good. He was riding the high of Christmas Vacation, and the end of his career wouldn't come until 1991, when three of his big films all flopped in a row. He hadn't yet been banned from SNL, and while many of the people who worked with him were aware of his reputation, it wasn't quite as publicly known.\n\n# Finally, the big roast\n\nIf you want, you can watch the full roast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quRVxBvN6M&ab_channel=DaBOBnKiLL). I highly recommend that you do, just because words can't really convey the atmosphere of it (and also 'cause it's funny to watch Chevy Chase get mocked). If you don't, no worries, the whole thing will be recapped below.\n\nThe roastmaster (picked by Chase) was Paul Shaffer. The roasters were Todd Barry, Richard Belzer, Stephen Colbert, Beverly D'Angelo, Al Franken, Greg Giraldo, Lisa Lampanelli, Nathan Lane, Marc Maron, Steve Martin, Laraine Newman, Randy Quaid, Freddie Roman, and Martin Short.\n\n**Who the fuck are these guys?**\n\nIf you read through that list of names and barely recognized anyone, you wouldn't be alone. Besides Colbert (who was still relatively unknown at the time) and Al Franken (who's famous for... other reasons now), there were *no* really famous people present. Steve Martin and Martin Short didn't even show up, they just sent in a pre-recorded video, as did Randy Quaid.\n\nNot only were most of the roasters unknown to the audience, but to Chase himself. As they repeated throughout the roast, most of them were younger, and knew Chase only through watching him. They'd never worked with him before, or even met him before they were asked to tear him apart on TV. The only three that really had any connection to Chevy were former SNL castmate Laraine Newman, SNL's band member Paul Shaffer, and Beverly D'Angelo, who had played his wife in National Lampoon's vacation. (I'm aware that Al Franken had a connection, but I'm refusing to acknowledge his existence).\n\n**Edit: I have received roughly ten million complaints about this. To clarify once again, famous people** ***present*** **because Short, Martin and Quaid never showed up. As for the rest of them, I'm just leaving them as is because it's funny how many people got genuinely angry at me over this.**\n\nReportedly, Chase would later ask one of the producers for the show why they hadn't invited any famous people. The simple answer was that they *had*... and everyone refused the invitation. \"We only roast the ones we love\" stopped being a sweet message, and became a condemnation. They didn't show up to roast him because they didn't love him.\n\n**The jokes varied, but most of them focused around a few main topics:**\n\n1. Chase's failed career, and the number of terrible movies he'd done.\n\n>Paul Shaffer: You made us laugh so much. And then inexplicably stopped in about 1978.  \n>  \n>Marc Maron: At least I am a nobody at the *beginning* of my career.\n\n2. The fact that none of Chevy's former friends or co-stars were willing to show up, so much so that they literally had a song and dance number called \"[We couldn't get anybody good](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=105)\". The song included the line\n\n>An OJ roast would have drawn more star power!\n\nMartin and Short also joked in their video that they couldn't come because were filming the Three Amigos sequel without Chevy... a joke that probably would have been a lot funnier for Chase if the two of them weren't actually making a number of movies together without him.\n\n3. Chase's drug addiction, which he had struggled with for years, and went to rehab for\n\n>Greg Giraldo: Chevy is living proof that you could actually snort the funniness right out of yourself.\n\n4. Chase generally being a dick\n\n>Laraine Newman (reading from her \"diary\" about the first SNL cast): Danny is hilarious, and has invited everyone up to his bar in Canada. Belushi is a little gruff, but it's obvious he's a sweetheart. Chevy said to me \"You know, the Holocaust never really happened\".\n\nThat joke was in response to Chevy's reputation for antisemitism, which another roaster would mock by chanting in Hebrew during the roast.\n\n**Hobbit said knock you out**\n\nHowever, probably the most brutal roast of all came from Stephen Colbert. If you watch only one part of the roast, make sure it's [these few minutes](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2088). Unlike the others, Colbert didn't swear much, or rip into Chevy's personal life. He even joked about how shocked he was by people's cruelty towards Chevy. Colbert tore Chase apart by getting deep into his insecurities, joking about his washed up career, with lines like:\n\n>The only thing I think of when I look at this man is there but for the grace of God go I. Why would I tempt the comedy gods to strike me down like this?  \n>  \n>A comedy lamprey, just sucking the joy out of everything I touch.  \n>  \n>But for some of these people, \\[fame\\] went to their head ... but this man never forgot what got him wherever he thinks he is.  \n>  \n>Before you attack him, think: There may come a day in your darkest hour when you are a shadow of your, albeit paper-thin self. And when that day comes, I hope that you are cheered up by something that Mr. Chase so famously said, \"He's Chevy Chase and you're not.\" If that doesn't cheer you up, then I don't know what will.\n\nTurning Chase's most iconic line into a burn against him had to sting, but Colbert's entire speech impacted Chase pretty heavily. With the others, the jokes were almost *too* over the top, it was easier to laugh them off. Imagine the difference between someone telling you \"I fucked your mom\" vs \"You have been nothing but a disappointment to your mother. You'll never be good enough for her.\" Colbert tore Chase apart with the precision of a surgeon, all with a pleasant grin on his face.\n\n**I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me**\n\nAfter Colbert was \"Sir\" Randy Quaid, whose [poetry tribute to Chevy](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2292) was... it's an experience. This has basically no relation to any of the rest of the drama, but it's too bizarre for me to not mention it here. It features a swimsuit-clad Quaid frolicking in a pool, moving into various sexual poses as his voiceover recites a Shakespearean poem. Eventually, he moves towards a pair of women's legs spread wide... which have a picture of [Chevy Chase](https://imgur.com/a/YA4OAmj) over the genitals.\n\nYou may now pause reading to go scrub your eyes with bleach.\n\n**The grand finale**\n\nAs the last roaster left the podium, and as Chase was thanked for being a good sport by the head of the Friar's Club, all eyes turned to him. This was his big moment, his time to strike back at everyone. You can say a lot of things about Chevy Chase, but lacking the ability to insult people isn't one.\n\nChevy took the podium, and... [not much happened](https://youtu.be/2quRVxBvN6M?t=2392). He kicked it off by saying \"I agree with everything that's been said\", threw back a joke or two, then left. His voice broke as he noted that this would be the time the roastee got even with all the other comedians, \"but there just fucking aren't any\". In total, the whole thing took around 80 seconds, much of which Chevy was silent for. When he did speak, his trademark arrogance and bravado was gone.\n\n**And he cried like a baby coming home from the bar**\n\nChase himself admitted that after the show, he went back to his hotel room and had a breakdown. He reportedly cried for hours in a depressive state, with Paul Shaffer coming to comfort him. [According to Chevy](https://ew.com/article/2012/04/03/chevy-chase-archive/), the roast was the moment he hit rock bottom, when he truly realized how badly he'd fucked up with his former friends. The roast truly devastated Chevy, and would haunt him for years to come.\n\nLooking back through the broadcast, you can see an almost linear progression of Chevy's reactions, growing more and more stolid as it went on. He'd barely react to jokes beyond the bare minimum, or sometimes not react at all. He just sat there stone faced with sunglasses on.\n\nThe show was supposedly pretty uncomfortable for everyone else. Looking back at past Friar's club roasts, it's hard to not notice the difference in the atmosphere. Members of the crew, audience, and cast have all expressed some levels of discomfort with what happened, and many of them just wanted to move on and act like it never occurred. Even in previous roasts, no matter what was said, you could fall back on the fact that people liked you. The sad fact is, nobody in that room *really* liked Chevy all that much, and a decent number of them *hated* him.\n\nReportedly, Chase even insisted that certain jokes be cut entirely from the show before it was broadcast. I was unable to find proof of if Chase was specifically involved, but the broadcast has clearly been edited. There's shots where Chase seems to transition from his sunglasses to his regular glasses quickly, and some of his roasters seemed to have vastly different speaking times. Some of them barely even mentioned Chevy, so the idea that some of their jokes got cut isn't too far fetched. Compared to the other Friars Club roasts that aired, this one ran on the shorter end, suggesting there could be around 5-8 minutes of cut footage. And considering what actually made it onto the broadcast, you have to wonder how truly gut wrenching those insults must have been.\n\nRegardless of editing, Comedy Central would only ever air it once before shelving it.\n\n# What comes next?\n\nAt some points during this writeup, you may have wondered where the big sweeping changes were. After all, a roast of a celebrity by a bunch of strangers, many of whom aren't comedians, who use extremely personal jokes and attacks? That's not anything special, it's pretty much *every* major roast, especially on Comedy Central.\n\nThe thing is, this roast is a large part of what created all of those. Obviously, it's less shocking to us now, because it has become the norm, but at the time, this was an entirely new experience. And it was an experience that Comedy Central jumped on with enthusiasm. After Chase's roast, their five year contract with the Friar's club ended, and it was not renewed. Some suggested that Chase personally sabotaged the deal, although more likely it just represented the end of a short experiment. Comedy Central then started producing their own roasts, following the new model. Turns out, people are a lot more entertained by celebrity drama than close friendships, and they're happy to see someone famous knocked down a peg or two. Plus, you don't need to actually get comedians if you just hire a writing team for all the celebrity guests, and star power attracts a lot of viewers.\n\nRoasts have since become a classic part of comedy culture, with Comedy Central firmly at the peak, and Chase's legacy enshrined forever -- just maybe not the way he'd want it to be.\n\nBelieve it or not, Chase is [still an asshole](https://ew.com/tv/chevy-chase-responds-snl-community-costars/). He has gone in and out of retirement, currently stating that he's only semi-retired. He also tried to convince Lorne Michaels to let him host SNL again... just minutes before he walked his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. Priorities man. If you want to take the time, there's a good [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/chevy-chase-cant-change/) that dives into Chevy, and discusses the nuances, exploring his abusive childhood without excusing his current behavior.\n\nAlso, the roast was spoofed by [American Dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtUYAHTmJI&ab_channel=santaonthecross), sunglasses and all. Funnily enough, that's how I learned about this, and decided to make a writeup.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is simple: If you're an asshole, a narcissist, a bigot, a douchebag, a sexist, a failure in every conceivable way... at least you're not Chevy Chase.", "ID": "xk73sy", "Score": 19337, "Ratio": 0.97, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/", "Number of comments": 1370, "Comments": {"ipcaers": {"Author": "mandalorian_guy", "Parent ID": "t3_xk73sy", "Body": "I do like the slight detour in to Randy Quaid's insanity.

Low and behold there was Chevy playing the grandpa. \n\nIt was sad and kind of depressing how far he has fallen. I’ve never understood his mindset,  he’s a real bastard to a lot of people like he’s some major star, but then he will turn around and willingly do horrible low budget movies for a dime because he literally can’t get anything else because of his attitude. \n\nHe thinks highly of himself and treats others like garbage, but he is a prime example of how the mighty have fallen.

This definitely paints a new portrait of Chevy Chase, and he used to be some sort of a household name with my family, like a favorite wholesome comedian and actor, or something like that.\n\nWhen I was a kid in the 90s, of course I had seen parts of, if not the whole movies, of Vacation and Christmas Vacation on TV, and in my family's house, our TV was always a \"basic cable\" package, so any time these movies came on, quite censored and ridden with commercials. I even remember when Vegas Vacation came out, and it seemed to do pretty well, I don't remember ever hearing from anybody how much they didn't like it / hated, I never heard about it flopping or anything like that, hell... I think Beverly D'Angelo was up for some kid's choice award one year for that movie, but my memory is foggy on that. Then I remember he was in Snow Day not long after that, I loved that movie so much as a kid, until I got older and grew to hate living in California because, at least the part of the state I live in, RARELY ever gets snow, and never would get enough for schools to close (it really fucking sucked, especially so since I hated having to go to school, lol).\n\nAnyway, when I was about 13 or 14 around 2003, my mom started relaxing about, and being cool with my checking out quite the range of R-rated movies, either from video rentals (Blockbuster or Hollywood Video), or even the public library. My first act of business was getting Vacation because, at the time, I didn't even know if I had ever seen the whole thing. Of course I followed that with European Vacation, which I never even knew before then existed. European actually remains my favorite of the Vacation movies.\n\nMy mom, and my uncle, also influenced my interests quite so. Because of them, I started checking out Foul Play, Seems Like Old Times, Used Cars, Escape From New York, The Blues Brothers, Neighbors (the one with Belushi and Aykroyd), Continental Divide, Stripes, Private Benjamin, Spies Like Us, EVERY John Hughes movie, Westworld, Futureworld, Logan's Run, MANY film and TV adaptations of Stephen King works, all of the Planet Of The Apes movies, Caddyshack, Dragnet, The 'Burbs, MANY Jack Nicholson movies - especially One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but also including others like Five Easy Pieces and The Last Detail (Last Detail being the earliest I know of with Randy Quaid); but of course I'd check out other stuff I'd somehow hear or read about, maybe catch references to from TV shows like Futurama or South Park, like The Terminator and A Clockwork Orange.\n\nI feel like by this point, it would just be easier to mention which Chevy Chase movies I HAVEN'T seen, which I think are just Man Of The House and Cops And Robbersons (not including anything else between Hot Tub Time Machine and now, and he simply appeared in that one, he wasn't the main actor in it; but I think Hot Tub Time Machine was the last that he was in that I did see), and yes, I've even seen ones like Modern Problems, and Nothing But Trouble; I feel like, I'm one of maybe 2-5 people on Earth that actually like Nothing But Trouble. It's hilarious, all the crazy and wacky shit going on in it.\n\nIt definitely makes it hard now, to continue enjoying all those movies now that I know what an asshole he is. Like, they're all still good movies, but at what costs to the production crews and co-stars that worked around him for each and every one...\n\nGreat work on this write-up, but damn :(  \nAlso, poor Kevin Smith; I remember that one line or part in Mallrats where Brody mentioned his copy of Fletch (might have been going on about \"custody\" over material objects between he and his girlfriend who dumped him, lol, so obviously Kevin was a fan of Fletch).", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 2, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/j0tjc84/"}, "j1ofr1k": {"Author": "Pixeljammed", "Parent ID": "t3_xk73sy", "Body": "I feel bad for him but also not.

As, I believe, the context behind this was that during the Fourth Season, infamous for lacking creator and otherwise show runner Dan Harmon, was *bad*. Really bad. Even in characterisation it was *bad*. Chase’s character, Pierce, was made more out of touch and racist in that season, and in a heated argument Chase said something along to “Next you’ll have me call Donny and Yvette a [N Word]\".

I think it was Gallagher’s first appearance on Carson too, which I don’t need to tell you is a big deal for a comedian. Chase spent the whole evening 1) Essentially sexually harassing Barbara Bach (I think you can even see him grabbing her a bit just off camera - nasty stuff) and 2) Needlessly trying to take the piss out of Gallagher and embarrassing him during his big break. Gallagher handles it really well and I think succeeds in turning it around on Chase, but I think it’s a great window into how petty and abusive he is.

From his Wikipedia page: \n\n>\tHis SNL appearances started with the first show, on October 11, 1975. He made 16 SNL appearances in all, doing routines from his comedy act, such as the Mighty Mouse singalong, Foreign Man, and the Elvis impersonation. After he angered the audience with his female-wrestling routine, Kaufman in January 1983 made a pretaped appearance (his 16th) asking the audience if he should ever appear on the show again, saying he would honor their decision. SNL ran a phone vote, and 195,544 people voted to “Dump Andy” while 169,186 people voted to “Keep Andy”.[49]\n\n>\tDuring the SNL episode with the phone poll, many of the cast members stated their admiration for Kaufman’s work. After Eddie Murphy read both numbers, he said, “Now, Andy Kaufman is a friend of mine. Keep that in mind when you call. I don’t want to have to punch nobody in America in the face”, and Mary Gross read the Dump Andy phone number at a rate so fast that audiences were unable to catch it. The final tally was read by Gary Kroeger to a cheering audience. As the credits rolled, announcer Don Pardo said, “This is Don Pardo saying, ‘I voted for Andy Kaufman.’”[50]\n\nThe “female wrestling” thing is a whole other story altogether (the very short version is that Kaufman became fascinated with the concept of kayfabe in wrestling and created a character, inspired by famous wrestling heels, whose whole schtick was to challenge women  in the audience to wrestle him; he eventually got his ass kicked in a fight with actual professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, although no one knew at the time that the fight had been staged).", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 130, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/ipehnz4/"}, "ipegomn": {"Author": "PaladinHan", "Parent ID": "t1_ipegby9", "Body": "Essentially, he refused to rehearse or get to know the cast, just showed up and ad libbed at his whim.

There were a couple of events that really stuck with me and drove that progression.\n\nThe first was when I was attending Bible college. I was raised in an almost all white school and went to an all white church, so naturally (and completely ironically) I completely believed that racism was sort of \"done\" and that Christians would follow Jesus and be against it and accept anyone regardless of who they were. But at the bible college one day I noticed that every single black student was sitting at the same table, and that there were only 10 of them. When I noted that, people immediately seemed to turn that *against them*. The explanation they gave was that they must just be more comfortable not being the only black person sitting at a table, but failed to notice that the implication of that was that they were being *made* unwelcome at other tables. After that, I noticed a subtle but significant change in cadence and conversation in the instances where the black students were around. It was like everything was more uncomfortable.\n\nThe second was years later, when I was at an actual school. In the class we were learning about racial-based equality issues with the medical system. In that class we had several people from minority groups, and because part of the class was a group discussion period, people expected them to comment on their own experiences. It was completely and totally obvious that they were doing their best to try and explain their real experiences without calling us racist, despite the fact that we clearly were treating them differently. The white students, including to some degree myself, seemed to be most interested in receiving assurance they *they* were not part of the racists, but rather were the good ones. It was and is pathetic.\n\nSorry that this comment got too long, but those two events stuck with me, because in both events I was clearly a participant in the racist status quo, and both of them featured black people doing their best not to offend us, while white people gloated in how not racist they were. It is just infuriating even by proxy. I can not imagine what it must be like to be on the receiving end of constant othering. Even if every event is minor enough to be explained away, in totality it adds up to something immense. You have every right to be pissed off, not that you need my or anyone else's permission. Anger is the only response that makes sense.\n\nI don't know what to do about it from my position. As a white person I inevitably participate in the social systems that otherize minorities, and so it is my responsibility to do my best to stop, but there is such an overwhelming number of false beliefs about reality, and about my own natural grace, that I keep finding news ways I am participating. But if I and others don't figure out how to be better people, our global society will always be worse off for it.\n\nIt is also not your responsibility to teach us how to be better. It is 100% on us. I just had a bit of an epiphany that I need to stop letting other white people complain about Black people being upset about racism. By not actively challenging that, despite it being objectively racist, I am still participating in a society that deems racism to be the natural state.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 18, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/xk73sy/comedy_how_to_piss_off_everyone_youve_ever_met_so/itx3jsp/"}, "iqmsxfx": {"Author": "DoctorJJWho", "Parent ID": "t1_iqm2j0l", "Body": "No worries I’ve just watched Bojack way too many times, it is tied for my favorite show of all time haha.

Our story follows the calamitous ramifications that came from the overlooking of one line of code in the weeks before this expansion's launch. But in the words of Nozdormu there is only one true timeline, and the events which will eventually set this story into motion begin more than 10 years ago, on September 25, 2012.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n#Part 1: Out of the Mists\n\nOn September 25, 2012, Mists of Pandaria, the fourth World of Warcraft expansion, released. Players rushed to explore the newly-discovered island of Pandaria seeking riches, adventure, and of course, mounts.\n\n###*What are mounts (and why should I care)?*\n\nFor those who haven't played WoW or similar online games, players tend to focus heavily on making sure that their character *looks* cool. Whether it’s to stand out in groups and show off, or because players enjoy dressing up and decorating their avatars to fit the story they want to weave around them, character appearance and accessories are a central aspect of the game. Much like in real life, people in-game dress up to impress both others and themselves. \n\nThere are a lot of ways to do this, but one of the most common ones is collecting mounts (the vehicles that players use to run, swim, and fly around in the world). Mounts are large, flashy and, unlike armor and weapons, don’t become obsolete when a new expansion releases. Like other rewards in the game, mounts come in varying degrees of rarity, with the least attainable often being the most coveted, and some are incredibly rare. Some of the rarest mounts in the game are owned by less than 1% of the playerbase years after their introduction to the game, [and ones that can be traded outside the game can go for absolutely obscene amounts of money.](https://i.imgur.com/BbGLqid.jpg)\n\nNot all players farm mounts based on their prestige, mind you. Some simply go after mounts that they think look cool. At present there are [over 900 mounts in the game](https://www.dataforazeroth.com/collections/mounts), ranging from [dragons](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/108480-reins-of-the-bronze-drake.jpg) to [an undead flying horse named Invincible](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/983372-invincibles-reins-booyaa.jpg) to [a giant robot helicopter head](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/479770-mimirons-head.jpg), so rest assured that there’s something for everyone! \n\nHowever, every once in awhile you get a mount that’s both obscenely rare *and* that the community thinks looks especially cool, and suddenly everyone wants it; either so that they can fly around on it, or so that they can flex on the noobs that can’t. \n\n###Back to Pandaria: Enter The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent\n\nIt’s 2012. As players storm the shores of Pandaria, many charge towards a new world boss called **The Sha of Anger**, one of a pair of newly added and extremely difficult enemies that randomly spawn in two of the game’s outdoor zones. The Sha can be killed every 15 minutes, but can only be looted once per week, with the chance to award high-quality armor (among other things). Many players are hunting down the Sha to get said armor (their old gear having become obsolete with the new expansion), but many more are after a more elusive prize listed on the boss’s loot table: [[The Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent]](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/570281-reins-of-the-heavenly-onyx-cloud-serpent.jpg). \n\nThe Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is coveted because of its visually striking design and bright colors. It both looks good and stands out in a crowd (literally glowing with bright white light), which means everyone wants it. But as more and more of the unwashed masses spill upon the continent of Pandaria to slay the Sha in an attempt to get their very own photonegative dragon, one thing becomes clear. It’s rare. Possibly more rare than any mount added to an enemy’s loot table before. Unlucky players who didn’t get the mount on their first try will have to simply wait until the weekly loot-lockout resets on Tuesday to try and kill him again, or bring their alts (additional characters on their account) to kill him for extra tries. \n\nThe weeks pass by. Players begin doing the new raids and out-gear the armor offered by the Sha of Anger, but he continues to be beaten to death nearly as soon as he spawns by a massive, rabid community of increasingly frustrated mount hunters. The more kills players rack up without seeing the mount, the more rare they realize it is, which makes getting it all the more prestigious and increases the desire to farm it further. Someone asks Blizzard to confirm the mount is actually in the game and there isn’t some hidden requirement to unlock it, which Blizzard does, insisting that it just has a low drop rate. \n\nWeeks turn to months. Someone runs a database search and discovers that **nobody in the game of 10 million players has the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent yet**. They take this information to a forum post that’s directed at Blizzard. The community becomes upset as they realize they’ve been farming a mount that may not actually be in the game yet. Blizzard realizes they made a mistake. \n\n###Oops, no dragons! - *How Blizzard broke the Sha’s loot table (the first time)*\n\nSo what happened? Well, the Sha of Anger’s loot table works as follows:\n\n1. When a player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game internally rolls a random number ranging from 1 to 100. \n\n2. If the game rolls a 1 to 59, the player receives gold and nothing else happens.\n\n3. If the game rolls a 60 to 100, the player is marked as receiving a piece of loot, at which point the game rolls a SECOND random number to determine what piece of gear the player is awarded from a weighted loot table of class-specific armor (so that a rogue doesn’t accidentally get paladin armor, which they can’t use). The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is on this loot table as an incredibly low drop. \n\nWell, that’s how it’s *supposed* to work. In reality, Blizzard either never added the Heavenly Onyx Serpent to the loot table, or accidentally set the weighted chance of awarding it to 0. (They never clarified which they had done, only that they’d made a mistake and fixed it).\n\nSo we’re a few months into Mists of Pandaria and all is finally right with the world (of Warcraft). The Sha of Anger has begun dropping its mount as intended. Overjoyed (and irate) players flock to kill him with new found hope and optimism and soon discover a second, far more horrifying truth…\n\n**It’s still insanely rare.**\n\nThe reason Blizzard took so long to realize the mount wasn’t dropping was because, even when correctly added to the loot table, it was so rare that it almost never dropped. The game doesn’t officially publish any sort of drop percentages for its loot, but estimations made by players put it somewhere between a 0.02% to a 0.01% drop rate. That means that on average, the Sha will drop *one* mount every 7,500 kills. One of, if not **the**, lowest drop rate of any mount in the game.  \n\nWhen it became clear just how rare this mount truly was, many players (such as myself) gave up on farming it. It just wasn’t worth the hours of camping and thousands of attempts it would take (spread out over multiple years or multiple max-level alts) to farm the Sha for such a tiny chance at getting the mount, no matter how cool it looked. Others made as many characters as they could and parked them at the spawn points to get as many kills as they could each week, racking up thousands of kills over hundreds (or thousands) of hours of farming.\n\nAnd the world (of warcraft) spun on. The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent remained one of the most prestigious mounts in the game due to its unique look, bugged introduction, and tiny drop chance. After ten years of farming it’s owned by less than 1% of the game’s playerbase, and when it occasionally appears on the Black Market Auction House (an in-game market where a single instance of a rare non-tradeable item is made available for purchase at auction with gold) it regularly goes for the game’s maximum gold cap of 9,999,999 gold (currently valued at 900 USD [based on the WoW game-time token’s US regional price](https://wowtokenprices.com/)).\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n># “*You must decide which path you will take. Which story you will tell. An ancient enemy has returned. You will play a part in the events to come and you will have to make a difficult choice, as we did. My story is already written. But yours - and that of all Dracthyr - is only beginning to unfold.*”\n\n-Nozdormu, Dragon Aspect of Time\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n#Part 2: The Unwitting Herald(s)\n\nOn September 11, 2022, nearly 10 years to the day from the first explorers setting foot onto the shores of Pandaria and beginning the long chain of events that are now so close to their culmination, a redditor by the name of u/Jibbles2020 will [make a post that unknowingly heralds the impending chaos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/xbtu4a/yeah_so_i_just_got_the_heavenly_onyx_cloud/).\n\nJibbles is playing on the Dragonflight Beta, a test version of the new expansion that a small group of players are invited to try out before the official launch in order to test the functionality of new systems and gameplay mechanics. Importantly, items earned on the beta **cannot be kept when the beta closes** and **are not transferred to your main account**. \n\nToday, Jibbles is trying out the new race/class combination added in the Dragonflight Beta, the Dracthyr Evoker. After completing the introduction questline Jibbles finds himself flying through Pandaria and notices that the Sha of Anger is up. “*Why not?*” he thinks to himself, landing and quickly dispatching the boss that he outlevels by five expansions. \n\n*The unthinkable happens to Jibbles.*\n\n**He gets the mount.**\n\nWhat would be a cause of boisterous celebration at any other time leaves a bittersweet ache in Jibbles’ chest. The cruel whims of RNJesus have decided to award him a mount dropped every 1 in 7,500 kills on a test account he will lose when the expansion launches in a few weeks. \n\nJibbles takes this painful irony in good spirits and posts about his horrible luck on the WoW subreddit where, amazingly, another user, u/Bodehn, [mentions that the same thing happened to her while testing her Dracthyr on the beta](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/xbsvcj/oh_god_damn_it/).\n\nThe community shares a laugh in solidarity with these two players, and the astronomical luck (both good and bad) it must have taken for both of them to get the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent within a day of one another on a temporary server that will close within a month. \n\nNone among the posters or commenters consider that this could be anything more than a fluke. A freak accident that befell two unfortunate beta testers. Some commenters joke about how this is a prime example of why you should never kill a boss that drops a rare item on the beta. Others speculate that it would be funny if Blizzard made drop rates higher on the beta as a joke. The posts drift off the front page as posts inevitably do, replaced by news of new features and content and release dates in the ever-changing whirlwind of information and excitement that comes with an expansion on the horizon. Jibbles and Bodehn, and their astronomically bad luck, are all but forgotten. \n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n># “*It is time! I will expend everything to bind every thread here, now, around the Dragon Soul. What comes to pass will NEVER be undone!*”\n\n-Nozdormu, Dragon Aspect of Time\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n#Part 3: Tuesday, November 15, 2022\n\n*The timeline that follows is reconstructed based on the progression of information recorded in forum, reddit, discord, and WoWHead posts related to Dracthyr and The Sha of Anger over the course of the evening on Tuesday, November the 15th. Stories told from the perspective of a specific character are speculative retellings based on an accurate timeline of when and how community knowledge about the event developed, and are informed by my experience as a mount farmer of 12 years who has participated in the discovery of similar bugs/exploits over my time playing the game. All events not related to a specific hypothetical character are completely factual.*  \n\n###It’s 6:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nAfter an extended maintenance lasting most of the day, phase 2 of the Dragonflight pre-patch has come online and is available to play on the live US/Oceanic servers (EU servers will not have access until tomorrow, as their maintenance is on Wednesday). With it comes the Dracthyr Evokers, available to players a few weeks ahead of the official expansion launch. \n\nIt takes about an hour to get a newly-created Dracthyr (who start at level 58) through the introductory questline and to the level cap of 60, at which point they are set loose to explore the world (of Warcraft) at their leisure.\n\n###It’s 7:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nDracthyr pour into the capital cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar en masse. Most unlock the ability to fly and head to kill elemental lords that have been added for a limited-time pre-patch event which also opened today. Others head to the city training dummies to test out their new class abilities. Others still begin flying to old raids and dungeons to farm armor sets that they think will look good on their new lizards. \n\nWe do not know how the event, ten years in the making and mere minutes away from its grand culmination, began. We do not know who first saw the Sha spawning in Kun-Lai Summit and decided to pause for a moment to try their luck. Perhaps it was a player in this last group, flying to some old raid in search of a staff or a pair of pauldrons. Perhaps it was one of those still camping the Sha weekly, hoping desperately for the mount and seeing their new Dracthyr as just another weekly 0.01% chance at the prize that has eluded them for so long. Perhaps it was even Jibbles or Bodehn, hoping in vain to relive their moment of glory. \n\nWe do not know how the event that is now at long last upon us began. \n\nBut we know what followed. \n\n###It’s 7:20pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years. \n\nThe mount farmers, fewer tonight due to the multitudes that have taken a break to enjoy the pre-patch festivities, are given their standard gold and long-worthless pieces of armor. \n\nBut this first Dracthyr, who has killed the sha of anger for the first time, receives something different.\n\nThey have received the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.\n\nPlayers take notice. It’s common to ride a new mount in celebration upon receiving it, and a character’s guild is automatically notified in the chat window when their guildmate receives an especially rare drop such as the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. At first the luck and humor of Blizzard’s new dragon race receiving this elusive dragon mount amuses those farming, offering the mix of curses and congratulations that so often follow a fellow player receiving a rare reward. \n\n###It’s 7:35pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.\n\nA second Dracthyr, either encouraged by his comrade’s luck or simply making a quick pit-stop to try *their* hand at rolling the dice of fate, is among the masses who have beaten it down. Around them stand the mount farmers, many of whom were present at the kill which occurred at 7:20pm and have since switched to another alt for another 0.01% chance. \n\nThis Dracthyr, too, has received the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. \n\nWhen bugs, especially beneficial ones, are discovered in World of Warcraft, the process is often more akin to the breaking of a dam than the flipping of a switch. In a game with as many random numbers as WoW it can be hard to differentiate what should be attributed to luck from what may be the result of something more. \n\nBut this is odd. \n\nMount farmers and guildmates alike have seen a Dracthyr get a mount that should drop once every 7,500 kills twice within the past hour, and each must have been the character’s first-ever attempt. \n\n###It’s 7:50pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.\n\nFive Dracthyr stand around it this time, and while not every one receives a dragon, two do. Oddly, none receive armor. \n\nCalculating and estimating drop rates is something that almost becomes second nature to long-time WoW players. Knowing how likely you are to get a mount, pet, or piece of armor allows you to more efficiently decide how best your time in the game should be spent in order to reap the maximum number of rewards possible, or be the most likely to receive the specific reward you want. Dedicated mount farmers are especially adept at calculating these rates, as knowing your odds of receiving a mount allows you to estimate the average amount of farming time required to get your coveted prize. \n\nThe most accurate way to determine an item’s drop rate is to review data submitted by other players about whether or not they received the item after killing the boss. If 500 players kill a raid boss and 5 get a mount, it is likely that the boss has around a 1% chance of dropping that mount (assuming all players had equal odds to receive the item, as is *usually* the case with rare drops such as mounts). As with any statistical estimation, the larger your sample size is the more accurate your estimation will be. But while a sample size of two Dracthyr is too small to accurately estimate anything beyond the fact that something has gone wrong with the Sha of Anger, a sample size of five begins to afford a very rough idea of odds. \n\nIt *appears* that Dracthyr have a 40% chance of receiving the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. \n\n###It’s 8:05pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.\n\nTwenty Dracthyr stand around it. Six ride glowing black and white dragons. Once again, none have received armor. \n\nOnly six riders indicates that perhaps the drop rate for Dracthyr isn’t quite 40%, but with a sample size this small variations are bound to occur.\n\nOne player, an avid mount farmer who has hunted the Sha for years and is intimately familiar with the way its loot table operates (due to the bug that occurred ten years ago) has just realized what happened.\n\n###Oops, all dragons! - *How Blizzard broke the Sha’s loot table (the second time)*\n\nIf you recall, the Sha of Anger’s loot table works as follows:\n\n1. When a player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game internally rolls a random number ranging from 1 to 100. \n\n2. If the game rolls a 1 to 59, the player receives gold and nothing else happens.\n\n3. If the game rolls a 60 to 100, the player is marked as receiving a piece of loot, at which point the game rolls a SECOND random number to determine what piece of gear the player is awarded from a weighted loot table of class-specific armor (so that a rogue doesn’t accidentally get paladin armor, which they can’t use). The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is on this loot table as an incredibly low drop. \n\nNote that each class has their own loot table in order to guarantee that each is able to use any armor awarded to them. \n\n**What then, hypothetically, might happen if a class simply did not have a loot table?**\n\n1. When **that** player kills the Sha of Anger for the first time each week, the game would internally roll a random number ranging from 1 to 100. \n\n2. If the game were to roll a 1 to 59, the player would receive gold as normal and nothing else would happen.\n\n3. But if the game rolled a 60 to a 100 and that player were marked as receiving a piece of loot, but the player in question did not **have** a weighted loot table of class-specific armor from which the game could choose a reward, then, hypothetically, the game would be forced to award the only piece of loot automatically added to each class's table. **The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.**\n\n###It’s 9:35pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done much more quickly every 15 minutes for the past two hours.\n\nA cloud of fourty Dracthyr riding fourty black and glowing white dragons rises from the corpse.\n\nAnother sixty Dracthyr sit down and begin a 20 second logout animation. Most of these Dracthyr have never sat before in their brief 65 minutes of existence. Many will never stand again. \n\nNews of the glitch has begun to spread like wildfire on private forums as players attempt to tell their friends of this unique opportunity to get one of the rarest mounts in the game. Most are careful to not announce the discovery **too** loudly or **too** publicly, knowing they likely have mere hours before Blizzard notices their mistake and rapidly corrects it, and the more openly they discuss what they’ve found, the sooner it is likely to be fixed. \n\nThe clock is ticking. Game breaking exploits like these tend to be fixed in hours, not days, and all know it will not last to the next loot reset occuring on November the 22nd, almost seven days away. A 40% chance is far higher than the typical 0.01%, but it’s not a guarantee, and while players can farm a coin that allows them to reroll for a second drop to improve their odds, many still find themselves among the unlucky few that do not walk away with a mount. These players know that if they want to benefit from this oversight, they need to do it **now**. But due to the high level that a Dracthyr starts at, the game prevents players from making more than one on any specific realm. \n\nUnless of course.\n\n*You simply deleted them.*\n\nHours after their painstaking creation and minutes after first stepping foot on the foreign soil of Pandaria, many of the Dracthyr unlucky enough to have not secured a mount for their player log out and are unceremoniously destroyed. Their deaths make way for the creation of new Dracthyr with, most importantly, new loot lockouts. No such time or consideration is taken in the creation of this second wave, a randomizer allows players to create their draconic cattle seconds faster, and those seconds could be the difference between making it to the Sha before Blizzard realizes and fixes their disastrous mistake. Where a few hours ago players leisurely explored the new introductory questline, taking in the sights and scenery so lovingly crafted by the developers, now a garish wave of blues and purples and whites and golds races through it with one unifying thought in their minds. \n\nEscape.\n\n###It’s 10:20pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, unceremoniously dispatched by waves of fire and a flurry of hundreds of flashing chromatic draconic fists within moments of its triumphant return. Many that felled the monstrosity are themselves dispatched mere seconds later in the midst of the resulting vortex of black and glowing white, having utterly failed in the singular purpose for which they were created. From the ashes of their destruction yet another generation of garish lizards rise and begin the 45 minute sprint to their own demise. \n\n#Wednesday, November 16, 2022\n\n###It’s 1:01am, Eastern Standard Time\n\nThe primary news aggregation site for World of Warcraft, WoWHead, has posted an article [notifying the playerbase that a loot issue has been discovered with the Sha of Anger that is providing Dracthyr a higher than normal chance to receive the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent](https://www.wowhead.com/news/hotfixed-sha-of-anger-and-nalak-loot-issues-with-evokers-mounts-are-the-only-329936).\n\n[Commenters report that Blizzard fixes the issue within minutes of this article being posted](https://www.wowhead.com/news/hotfixed-sha-of-anger-and-nalak-loot-issues-with-evokers-mounts-are-the-only-329936#comments).\n\n###It’s 1:20am, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThousands of brightly colored Dracthyr who have just finished their most recent mad dash through the introductory questline are joined by thousands more that have just read the new WoWHead article.

The Dracthyr that were lucky enough to kill the Sha in time will keep their mounts, the drop rate will stay as abysmally-low as it’s always been, and the world (of Warcraft) will spin on. For many, the prepatch experience has been soured slightly by the feeling that they’ve just missed their chance to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\nThen.\n\nFor the second time in as many days.\n\nThe unexpected happens.\n\nBlizzard releases a list of hotfixes (small adjustments or bug fixes made to the game outside of a major patch) that went live a few minutes ago.\n\nBuried among them, with no other mention of the chaos that has occurred over the last 24 hours, is one sentence:\n\n>##[“The drop chances for Son of Galleon's Saddle, Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent, Reins of the Cobalt Primordial Direhorn, Reins of the Thundering Cobalt Cloud Serpent, and Solar Spirehawk have been greatly increased.”](https://www.wowhead.com/news/drop-chances-for-mop-and-wod-world-boss-mounts-greatly-increased-329953)\n\nIt is not clear what greatly increased means.\n\nIt doesn’t matter.\n\n###It’s 10:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.\n\nTwo hundred players of all classes (although there are probably a few more Dracthyr, since it never hurts to hope a little) stand around its body. Each waits for the second it takes for the game to assign loot with bated breath.\n\nTwo players receive the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.\n\nThe drop rate is ~1%.\n\nAfter ten years spanning six expansions, the dream of the adventurers that first set foot on the shores of Pandaria so long ago are finally realized.\n\n**The Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent is farmable.** \n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n># “*Compared to all else that has happened, it is a small change to the timeline, and one of which I approve.*”\n\n-Nozdormu, Dragon Aspect of Time\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n#Epilogue\n\nSo what of your humble narrator? \n\nWell, dear reader, it’s not a HobbyDrama post without a little personal investment on the part of the author. For you see *I* was one of those players that stormed the shores of Pandaria more than ten years ago in hope of securing a Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent of my own.\n\nWhen the community finally determined just how rare the mount truly was, I gave up on farming it. Instead, like Jibbles or Bodehn or that first Dracthyr, I limited my attempts to the occasional pitstop on my travels. I racked up a few hundred kills between my alts this way over the past 10 years, but like a person buying a Powerball ticket when the pot gets large enough, I had never seen these kills as anything other than a fun shot at a mount I never actually expected to get.\n\nI was among those who suggested blizzard raise the rates to 1% over the years, as I don’t think any reward in a game like WoW should be so rare as to make it unfarmable. But much like with my occasional Sha kill, I never expected these recommendations to bear any fruit. \n\nI was not, sadly, among the garish waves of sacrificial drakes that felled the Sha on that fateful evening of November the 15th. I’d played for about an hour when the patch went live and leveled my Dracthyr through the starting area, but as those second and third Dracthyr were first discovering that something had gone wrong, I was logging off for the evening.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning to news that I’d missed a coin toss for a mount I’d wanted for the past decade. I was bummed that I’d missed my chance, but happy for the players that had been luckier than I had. Glitches like these (and the stories that come with them) are part of what make patches fun, and at the end of the day we’re all just trying to make our virtual little paper dolls look as cool as possible. I expected Blizzard would ignore this glitch now that it was fixed. “*Exploit early and often.*” is a saying in the WoW community for a reason, after all. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised when I saw the news that Blizzard had raised the drop rates, even if we didn’t know what they were yet. Like any good researcher I knew the only way to find out our collective odds was to contribute by adding yet another player to the kill data that is so critical to have, so I logged onto my character, flew to Kun-Lai Summit, and waited. \n\n#Wednesday, November 16, 2022\n\n###It’s 10:15pm, Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe Sha of Anger dies, as it has done every 15 minutes for the past 10 years.\n\nI stand among two hundred players of all classes, waiting for the second it takes for the game to assign loot with bated breath.\n\nThe loot window continues its animation for a half second longer than usual, telling me I’ve been awarded a piece of loot and the game is now rolling a second die to determine what I’ll receive from my class-specific table.\n\nThe window flashes to display the piece of loot that’s been selected for me. \n\n###[I have received Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent.](https://i.imgur.com/5WIiHhT.jpg)", "ID": "z9md4x", "Score": 12757, "Ratio": 0.97, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z9md4x/world_of_warcraft_how_blizzards_new_lizard_broke/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z9md4x/world_of_warcraft_how_blizzards_new_lizard_broke/", "Number of comments": 597, "Comments": {"iyhgsfy": {"Author": "uxianger", "Parent ID": "t3_z9md4x", "Body": "You know, I'm always glad when a bug is semi-ascended - when a mistaken loot table, or EXP table, or wrong spawn location, makes things better for those who did not get to take place.

Putting say 1,000 hours into a cosmetic item is seen as a badge of honor to flaunt.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 36, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z9md4x/world_of_warcraft_how_blizzards_new_lizard_broke/iyifkrv/"}, "iyhx8bu": {"Author": "Deleted", "Parent ID": "t3_z9md4x", "Body": "[deleted]", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 32, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z9md4x/world_of_warcraft_how_blizzards_new_lizard_broke/iyhx8bu/"}, "iyifyls": {"Author": "buriednotmarried", "Parent ID": "t3_z9md4x", "Body": "I really, really enjoyed reading this.

He's got brothers! Ish. Galleon, a giant lizard who drops a smaller lizard, Nalak, a lightning covered cloud serpent who drops an identical cloud serpent, less fancy than the Heavenly Onyx but still desired (let's. not talk about the black recolour of this and the suffering that is Huo), and Oondasta, an armored T-rex who drops a stone triceratops\n\nThe problem is that one of the classes, the hunter, is able to tame certain beasts. Two of these three count. Now, Galleon isn't tameable, but if he was? There isn't much demand for Galleon, as lizards identical to him in all but size are all over the zone, plus he would shrink down to their size once tamed, but the other two?\n\n... Nalak and Oondasta are unique appearances. No creature in the game looks identical to them. If you want a blue lightning-covered cloud serpent or an armored T-rex, you have to go and tame those two.\n\nYou must break the cycle of them dying ever 15 minutes, as they have done for the past 10 years. And all those people counting on them dying are going to be incredibly angry with you as, in taming them, in having them eternally bound to you as a pet for eternity? This only happens if you specifically tame them, preventing them dying and any drops from happening\n\nThere is no resolution from this. Thankfully, once a hunter has them, they're not coming back for round 2, as there's no need, and as far as pets go they aren't the most popular.

He had to go in to hospital in September and asked me to get the WotLK classic mount for him, which I of course did. He passed a month later but I was amazed to see him with 450 (now 452) mounts, it's good to see he had about half of all mounts.\n\nI'm updating the game now to check his account and if he had the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent. I know he talked about it and certainly had a couple of dedicated alts to do a few kills every week, but unlike his \"I got Invincible on Christmas Day!\" stories from last year, I don't remember him giddily announcing any other rarities, and he would *know* the drop chance of something that rare.\n\nThe last time I played with him was right before Shadowlands and he took me through a daily zone, showing me where certain silvers spawned. We stopped at one and he said \"This one drops a mount\", we kill it, I get my mount and we move on, me atop this little bug. We land at the next point and he goes \"Did you get that mount?\" I say yeah, of course, you said it dropped one, he replies \"Yeah, one in two hundred kills\".

Thought exercises of this nature aren't inherently harmful: just because we have speculations on what would happen if the Nazis win, it doesn't mean a majority of people wished this happened. I don't think intellectual exploration should be stifled just for some offended sensibilities. I'll use an example of the Hong Kong protests, which is probably the closest thing I can reasonably use as an point of comparison: despite my strong feelings on the issue, I don't think it's an inherently bad thing if someone wants to use it as a plot point of their story, or discuss the ramifications and nuances. To use another example, there are many jokes in western media, for instance the Simpsons, in regards to Tiananmen, or even the Cultural Revolution, from which one of my great grandparents was a survivor of. Perhaps a more relatable example is 'The Death of Stalin'. By your logic, the censorship of that film in Russia was justified because it offends sensibilities.

{"Title": "[Harry Potter Fandom] JK Rowling and the TERFed Child", "Author": "EquivalentInflation", "Subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "Body": "I was looking through this sub, and was *shocked* to find out that no one had done a post explaining JK Rowling's descent into Terfdom, and the insanity it caused. This is a cautionary tale, of fear and lust and pride. And also, how Vladimir Putin is apparently the same as her. Buckle up, it's gonna be a bumpy ride (insert Whomping Willow joke here).\n\nDisclaimer: At some points in this write up, it may seem like I hate JK Rowling. This is because I hate JK Rowling. However, this post more than just a personal vendetta, as I've done my best to provide actual evidence and minimally biased analysis. With that cleared up, let's get started!\n\n**Background**\n\nI probably don't need to explain who Jowling Kowling Rowling is, but for those who have been living under a rock, she wrote the Harry Potter books. In doing so, she became fabulously wealthy and successful, and amassed a rabid fandom. She had been an impoverished single mother when writing the first book, so she was celebrated as a feminist icon, as well as a \"rags to riches\" type story. Her twitter was known for adding some... details to the books (like how wizards would shit themselves), but it was regarded as more of a meme than anything else.\n\nAnd, if there's one thing the Harry Potter books taught us, it's that a charismatic leader who has some vaguely dark and ominous ideas beneath the surface should *always* be trusted.\n\n**The early days**\n\nRowling is a bit of a textbook case of \"I can't believe... yeah, actually I probably should have seen that one coming\". Her books have a lot of issues in retrospect (Jewish caricatures run the bank, Harry is canonically a slave owner, her werewolves are the single worst metaphor for gay people *ever*). However a lot of that could be brushed off as mistakes, or just the time period. She was writing these in the 90s and early 2000s, people can change.\n\nHowever, the prelude to this specific drama occurred mainly through her Twitter (although in retrospect, the books have some weird shit going on with gender, especially women). Rowling had a history of dancing close to the edge of transphobia, without making any clear statement. Generally, the response fell under the umbrella of \"we can't judge her based off this\" or \"Twitter is getting upset over nothing again\".\n\nRowling's first really worrying tweet came when she [tweeted in support of Maya Forrester](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/j-k-rowling-s-maya-forstater-tweets-support-hostile-work-ncna1105201). For those who don't know, Maya was fired for being openly transphobic, she then sued the company and lost. JK Rowling spoke out in favor of Maya. Again, pretty obvious what her intention was now, but at the time, the response was mostly some variation of \"she has free speech\" or \"she's just anti-cancel culture\". Some people did speak out criticizing her at the time, but it was mostly chalked up to Twitter drama.\n\nRowling also wrote some detective novels under a man's name (the irony is palpable). Her novels included some *extremely* transphobic elements, such as a serial killer who targeted women by dressing as a woman and going into bathrooms, and the *hero* of the books telling a trans woman that she'd be raped. Again, super obvious in retrospect, but at the time, the general response to any concern was \"Just because she wrote it doesn't mean she supports it.\" Nobody really took it that seriously. Rowling couldn't be a transphobe, right?\n\n**Rowling is a definitely a transphobe.**\n\nBefore I get started, I want to make something clear: JK Rowling is a transphobe. Period. You can post a five paragraph essay in the comments about how \"trans women are coming to steal my vagina\", or \"it's not transphobic to do XYZ transphobic thing\". It doesn't change the fact that Rowling is a transphobe. Kindly go shove a knarl up your ass.\n\nAlright, now that that's out of the way, we can move on to the ***DRAMA***, and boy howdy is there a lot of it. [This article](https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy) gives a full dive into the controversy, but we're going to go through it step-by-step here.\n\n**The original tweet**\n\n[The tweet](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269382518362509313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1269382518362509313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fa-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy). In short, it was an article which used the term \"people who menstruate\" (given that trans men or nonbinary people may still have their periods). Rowling responded with\n\n>‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?\n\nOnce again, bad (especially knowing what we know now), but most people originally brushed it off. People make bad jokes all the time, it's not like she actually doubled down on it.\n\n**She doubled down on it.**\n\nIn a [series of tweets](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269389298664701952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1269389298664701952%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fa-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy), Rowling brought her transphobia out from the cupboard under the stairs. I'll say this for her: she doesn't do anything halfway. You can read the full chain, but the summary is: she argues that trans people are trying to erase the \"reality of biological sex\" (a common TERF dogwhistle), and adds that she can't be transphobic because she has ~~black~~ trans friends.\n\n**Side note: What is a TERF?**\n\nSince that term is getting used a lot, I figured I should define it. There's plenty of good [articles](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/5/20840101/terfs-radical-feminists-gender-critical) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru75tTRRYOA&ab_channel=RileyJ.Dennis) that explain this better than I could, but: a TERF is a Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist, someone who believes feminism should not include trans women, because they're not \"really\" women. (Because the most feminist thing of all is... defining a woman by her ability to make babies. Alice Paul would be so proud.) Ironically, TERFS adopted the term at first, until it became popular, and now regard it as a slur. TERFS have become an issue worldwide, but are *especially* prevalent in England. They tend to be far more socially acceptable than other bigots by framing their policies as fighting *for* women rather than *against* trans people. Generally speaking, it tends to split more socially progressive people, while more conservative voices gleefully exploit it to bash trans people as the scapegoat of the week.\n\n**The blog post**\n\nAfter a serious pushback, Rowling wrote a [blog post](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/) apologizing for the harm she'd caused, and promising to do better. Kidding, she doubled down *again*. It's a long post, which you are welcome to read through, but for those who don't want to: the entire thing jumps from dogwhistle to dogwhistle to straight up transphobia. Rowling accuses trans women of being predators and liars, and claims that they're silencing anyone who speaks out against them. She comes *this close* to saying \"literally 1984\". She also opened up about a sexual assault she'd gone through, and how she was worried \"opening up changing rooms\" would cause more assaults, despite all statistical evidence showing that there was no increased risk of sexual assault in areas with trans inclusive bathrooms. Probably the most succint (and damning) part of the blog was this:\n\n>I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it.\n\nShe then tweeted, saying only [TERF wars](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1270749170215903232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1270787941275762689%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fa-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy).\n\n**The reaction**\n\nPeople were *pissed*. Rowling had been walking the line for a while, but after the blog, it was irreversible. Before, she could hide behind dogwhistles and legions of fans, but the blog made her transphobia directly and openly stated. Also, she did all this during Pride month.\n\nI wanted to pick some of the funniest/most educational/most famous Twitter responses to her, but... there are so fucking many. I just can't. If you want to see them, just check beneath any of her tweets linked above.\n\nBut the backlash wasn't limited to Twitter. This was HUGE. A number of other famous authors spoke up on it; there were dozens of news articles, hot takes, and Op-eds; [SNL did a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfefsxSF0sw&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive); pretty much the entire Internet was up in arms. Generally, people were against her, but unfortunately, whenever a famous person is willing to publicly state views, it makes it a whole lot easier for other people to latch onto it, causing a number of TERFs to come out of the woodwork and defend her. This has also been coupled with the typical Internet response to bigotry: It didn't really happen, and if it did happen, it was blown way out of proportion, and if it was proportionate, then was it *really* that bad?\n\n**Carrie on my wayward son**\n\nOut of all the craziness, there's one especially fun story. A few months before Rowling's tweet went out, she tweeted a message of praise and admiration for Stephen King, calling him one of her favorite writers. Then, later, when a fan asked King if he supported Rowling, he replied \"Trans women are women\", causing Rowling to immediately block him and delete her tweet praising him. King then joked that [Rowling had canceled him](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/05/24/jk-rowling-canceled-stephen-king-for-supporting-transgender-women/?sh=4b1a9bb04bf5).\n\n**The return of the golden trio**\n\nBut the real kicker of it all came when Rowling's protegees, the actors who had played her most iconic characters all publicly came out against her.\n\n[Daniel Radcliffe](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/daniel-radcliffe-responds-to-j-k-rowlings-tweets-on-gender-identity/) was the first to respond, via the Trevor Project no less. He politely stated that he still loved and respecting JK before going into a statement condemning her beliefs, and backing it up with actual statistics. [Emma Watson](https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson/status/1270826851070619649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1270826851070619649%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fa-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy) then tweeted out a message in support of trans people, suggesting several charities people could donate to. Even [Rupert Grint](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/03/22/rupert-grint-why-he-criticized-j-k-rowling-trans-comments/4796412001/), who rarely makes public statements took the time to speak out against Rowling.\n\nOther HP actors like [Bonnie Wright](https://twitter.com/thisisbwright/status/1270846127206588418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1270846127206588418%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fa-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy) spoke out as well (here's a [full list](https://ew.com/movies/every-harry-potter-actor-whos-spoken-out-against-j-k-rowlings-controversial-transgender-comments/)).\n\nFunny enough, the literal *only* Harry Potter actor who has openly supported Rowling is [Ralph Fiennes](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ralph-fiennes-defends-j-k-rowling-amid-trans-controversy-says-backlash-is-disturbing-4151944/), aka, Voldemort. The one person who is siding with Rowling is magic Hitler. I can't make this shit up.\n\n**The fans**\n\nRowling's credibility had already been turned into a meme before this, but this event was *explosive*. Fans who hadn't cared about her in years (or ever), suddenly leapt to attack or defend her. Twitter basically melted down (except more so than usual), and the r/harrypotter sub has officially made Rowling a persona non grata. Their rule 4 states:\n\n>Discussion of JKR's personal opinions is banned, defense of her words and actions will lead to a ban. This includes supporting her right to a platform to spread hate.\n\nWe're coming up on the two year anniversary of this, and it *still* will start a fight whenever it gets brought up.\n\n**What do you do with a problematic fandom?**\n\nThe majority of fans seem to disagree with Rowling, although there is debate on how to enjoy the Harry Potter world. Most of the cast have urged people to embrace the message of Harry Potter -- welcoming outsiders and misfits -- while ignoring the person who created it (which seems to be the general consensus among fans as well). Rowling has effectively become she-who-must-not-be-named among her own fanbase, to the point where there's a running gag of naming literally anyone *but* her as the author.\n\nRowling has become the center figure in pretty much any \"death of the author\" conversation. In short, (very simplified) it's a growing idea that the creator holds no true power over something after it's released. What's explicitly stated in the book/movie/game is canon, but any and all subjective interpretations can be seen as true. Since the Harry Potter fandom was already very, *very* well known for its Alexandrian Library worth of fanfiction, with a fanbase that had long disregarded Rowling, it wasn't a huge jump for people to cut her out of the picture entirely. Rowling may have written some words, but now those words belonged to the world, to the people, to the hearts and minds of dreamers, and most importantly, the smut writers.\n\nIn a way, Rowling's past actions backfired on her. She wrote the books with the (supposed) purpose of celebrating silenced voices, giving people who were outcasts a place to call home. She pushed relatively progressive social views (again, 90s and early 2000s), and publicly continued to speak on issues like feminism, inequality, racism, etc. In doing so, she created a fandom that tends far more towards the progressive side of things. Harry Potter fans can be shitty, rabid, toxic, and a general Chernobyl of hormones and shipping, but at the fandom's heart, it's a group of people who tend to be open and welcoming to a wide variety of marginalized groups, and *very* petty when needs be.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nI mean... \\*gestures at the rest of the post\\*. But in more detail:\n\nFans still hate/ignore Rowling. Meanwhile, she's gone full mask-off transphobia. I honestly can't link all the different tweets, headlines, videos, and meetings that she's put out (it's about three or four per week at this point). Seriously, if you want more examples, just scroll through her twitter feed. Some highlights include:\n\n* Holding a boozy TERF brunch at the same time time as a major trans protest, despite claiming she would \"stand by them\".\n* Fighting for multiple anti-trans bills in England (shocker)\n* Accidentally praising a *very* pro-trans Eurovision group\n* Holding multiple \"JK Rowling Lunch\" picnics simultaneously across England. I shit you not.\n\nRowling has also taken a serious financial hit, due to a general boycott against her (as well as just bad PR). The last Fantastic Beasts movie tanked (although it's hard to tell if it was because of a boycott, or because it was a Fantastic Beasts movie). Warner Bros has put the series on hold, and is reportedly questioning their continued dealings with Rowling. Frankly, at this point, Rowling has become sort of like Uranium enriched tea: tolerable in the moment, but slowly killing anything she touched (that joke will make sense in a minute). WB is reevaluating how much money new Harry Potter content can *really* bring in, especially with Rowling tainting it.\n\nWhen they filmed the \"Return to Hogwarts\" special, Rowling was very pointedly omitted, despite nearly every other cast member, director, etc. getting an invitation to come for a reunion. The unstated message was clear: Rowling was out. They'll never publicly say anything, because they're a spineless corporation, and she still wields some serious influence, but they are keeping the franchise as far away from her as possible. She's also been almost entirely sidelined from the new Harry Potter video game, Hogwarts Legacy (which, ironically enough, allows you to play as a trans character).\n\n**Putin**\n\nHey, you remember that weird thing I mentioned about Putin at the start? Yeah, [Vladimir Putin literally said he stood with JK Rowling](https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-cites-jk-rowling-trans-controversy-as-proof-the-west-likes-to-cancel-people-3627272). Let me be clear: this wasn't in 2020. *This was a few fucking weeks ago*. He compared his invasion of Ukraine to JK Rowling, and talked about his support of her (her ideas actually match up with his policies for LGBTQ people disturbingly closely).\n\nSo... satire is dead. Nobody could make anything weirder than that.\n\nEdit: The TERFs are in the comments, and it's a par-tay! (Sorry in advance mods).\n\nEdit 2: Since a lot of people have been going \"oH bUt ShE's UnDeR aTtAcK\":\n\n* She was never doxxed. She publicly bought a *literal fucking castle* (if this were a movie, people'd complain it was unrealistic), and made her address known. You can no more doxx her than you can doxx Joe Biden by saying \"he lives in the White House\".\n* People sent her shitty and horrible things online. Are those people bad? Yes. Are most of them just taking a chance to be shitty regardless of cause? Also yes. Trans people get harassed constantly (often by Rowling and her followers), and have *actual* violent crimes committed against them, so it's hard for me to feel much sympathy for Rowling.\n* Someone tweeted \"I wish you a happy pipe bomb in your mailbox\". Investigation showed no actual possession of a pipe bomb, and no attempt to make or use one, it was an attempt at a meme. Again: shitty to wish death on someone? Yes. Given that Rowling is actively bringing death to other people by denying aid to rape victims, I find it hard to care that she got a mean tweet.", "ID": "v4pdb1", "Score": 12237, "Ratio": 0.77, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v4pdb1/harry_potter_fandom_jk_rowling_and_the_terfed/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v4pdb1/harry_potter_fandom_jk_rowling_and_the_terfed/", "Number of comments": 1939, "Comments": {"ib7jf6t": {"Author": "nissincupramen", "Parent ID": "t3_v4pdb1", "Body": "Aaaand that's it.

The books will forever be special to me, but the memory of them are tarnished and something we should never forget. \n\nIt seems so obviously now, as a twenty-something, in the current social climate, just how problematic these books were from the start.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 71, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v4pdb1/harry_potter_fandom_jk_rowling_and_the_terfed/ib5kw5l/"}, "ib68n1b": {"Author": "agirlwithbenefits", "Parent ID": "t3_v4pdb1", "Body": "This kind of breakdown is long overdue, and the level of detail you've provided can only be commended.\n\nSaying that, I noticed four key points not already mentioned in other replies that are worth your attention:\n\n1. Robbie Coltrane has also voiced support for Rowling's descent into becoming a figurehead for the so-called Prosecco Stormfront. (The right-wing connections *aren't* coincidence - gender critical feminism often overlaps or serves as a somewhat rational gateway argument designed to ease those still on the fence into the pipeline, with this author's work carrying several further red flags you covered.)\n2. Like many of her kind, Rowling employs plausible deniability as a safety net, with supporters regularly trying to gaslight me into buying that a multimillionaire author with global media connections didn't have someone highlight concerns that her second pen name, as used for a series of books allowing the exploration of certain views in much stronger doses, is literally that of a fringe conversion therapist. She also knows that enough blind followers remain to drown out any dissenting voices, even resorting to the SLAPP method of harassment as a way of silencing a few herself. Not to make excuses on behalf of a corporate entity, but part of the reason WB is so reluctant to openly act is because the company is in a position ideal to such people, where they either need to be kept on the payroll in a desperate attempt to rehabilitate them, or they can instead be bought out, allowing their hatred to be propagated with new found cash injections. Either way, they feel victorious.\n3. As a direct result of a BBC award-winning essay she wrote, Rowling has been cited as a reason the UK was demoted on the ILGA's Rainbow Europe index, listing countries by their level of hostility to LGBT citizens. If you were still in any doubt at this point, her specific brand of hate speech isn't just recognised as toxic or responsible for inciting acts against trans people and organisations in the name of this harmful cause, but she was literally called out as a motivating factor that led to our present situation of being seen on the global stage as increasingly unwelcoming.\n4. Rowling's politics being projected through her work is something that has been examined at length, though not her attempts to create social cliques with active Members of Parliament representing both Labour and the SNP, who had named figures present at that very public meeting in London recently, held simultaneous to a demonstration against the exclusion of trans people from a proposed conversion therapy ban. Now their singular platforms can be pushed back against, TERFs are adopting a new strategy of trying to influence the scientific world, academia, political spheres of either leaning... anyone who hasn't yet dismissed them as broken and beyond reason, which is something they'll often accuse us of being.\n\nI love that so many are joining in this fight, but to provide a little personal background, the first considerable red flag I noticed specific to transphobia was the metaphor obvious in hindsight of a giant snake invading a female bathroom as a significant narrative thread so early into her career, though JK has never been the most subtle of writers!", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 86, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v4pdb1/harry_potter_fandom_jk_rowling_and_the_terfed/ib68n1b/"}, "ib5c5j5": {"Author": "CheerilyTerrified", "Parent ID": "t3_v4pdb1", "Body": "I will never understand why the opposition to trans rights became such a massive massive issue in the UK.

However so was extreme fat phobia, 'I got mine, fuck you' values, permissive ideas about slavery, and so much other shit it's genuinely uncomfortable to go back once you notice it. \n\nGo ahead, try asking her why Harry and friends put tiny Santa hats on the shrunken heads of the former elf slaves of Black Manner. Inquire as to why Harry's first thought when he seens Slughorn forcing a house elf to test his items for poison is that 'Hermoine will be mad'. Not 'this is fucking disgusting'. But that Hermoine will get angry if she sees it. Harry also never changes from this position. This isn't a 'character flaw' moment that needs to be unlearned. It's just accepted that Hermoine is 'annoying' about the house elves and will get mad when she 'thinks' they're being hurt. Which they veritably are.

Saying she's 'forcing her thoughts on their culture' and using language that's really fucking close to the language slave owners in the real world used to justify why their slaves were 'happy' to be used. Or how they would become depressed shells of their former selves if freed, like Winky. \n\nHermoine, remember, who she later retconned to be black when Cursed Child came out.

And very funny. A much-needed write-up.\n\nFor people disturbed and disappointed by the replies linking to the older cast members who defend her or say we the young people are wrong in our outrage, I’m happy to report that Dame Emma Thompson (who played Professor Trelawny in the movies) [added her name to a letter in 2019](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi8_K6EzJT4AhUQ8DgGHS5HCUoQFnoECAQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.out.com%2Fcelebs%2F2019%2F3%2F04%2Fmedia-transphobia-has-stop-says-letter-signed-emma-thompson&usg=AOvVaw3_oNsKnhFXiq6ff7HDcEhw) that condemns TERFS and shows support of trans and non-binary voices in media. \n\n\nShe’s 62 now, and her career debuted the same time as Stephen Fry, Robbie Coltrane, also in their sixties and sided with Rowling for different reasons. \n\nWhen asked about her opinion on the Rowling debacle in a 2021 Vogue profile promoting her movie *Cruella*, this is her initial reaction:\n\n> She is quiet for a moment. “I have lots of thoughts on it, which I talked to lots of people about, which I’m not going to bring up in this,” she says, carefully. “The forum and fora in which it’s been discussed have been filled with such horrifying violence, on both sides.” She tells me the rare place she finds “succour” is with her 21-year-old daughter, Gaia. “She’s streaks ahead of me and I have very interesting conversations with her friends who are gay or who are trans or who aren’t sure, and there I find great nourishment and love.”\n\n> Initially, I was going to leave all this out of the interview – it felt wrong to chuck a fearful Thompson unwillingly into the toxic Twitter waters (she doesn’t do social media), and how necessary were the thoughts of another cis celebrity anyway? But it says something about her character that a worry persists that she hasn’t said enough; that a matter of societal importance has been raised and a show of empathy, and a point of view, have not been forthcoming.\n\nSo, then:\n\n> A couple of days later, an email pings in: “I have too much in my head at the moment to sleep very well and have been pondering the nature of human rights and my relationship with same,” she writes in her fast, fluid style. “I like using the word tools now – for what we call rights I think are merely the tools that we need to conduct ourselves through life in a healthy and humane fashion. **So trans rights, which to some have come out of the blue and seem staggeringly strange – but which of course have always been needed because like female intelligence and homosexuality, transsexuality has always been there but hidden or unseen or forced into hiding – for self-protection – must be fought for and upheld just like any other.**\n\n> “My passion for women’s rights has driven me all my life,” the message continues, **“and so, of course, I am bewildered when women of my age are insulted and threatened and fired because they haven’t said the right thing. I fear that kind of event.** So both feelings are true – trans rights are as incontrovertibly necessary and desirable as women’s rights. The space in which we discuss and put these rights into process must be made safe for everyone. I guess that’s the bottom line, or at least one of them. Onwards.”\n\nSo while it sounds like she’s both-sidesing it, (suggesting that Maya TERF woman was not in the wrong, that’s who she’s talking about I presume) this provides great insight of someone who’s scared by all this online activism they hear of that’s capable of dogpiling hate on a person *who they know and worked with irl* (we could come for them next if they misspoke!) but is progressive enough, open-minded enough to care.\n\nWhat we need to arrive at is of course, intersectionality. People have to bridge it, make people like Thompson understand that Transgender rights are women’s rights. There’s no GLB rights without Trans rights. When there’s human rights violation in a place, transgender people are first to be targeted. It’s not a zero-sum game. \n\nWelp, I hope this helps.

Instead, they're a bunch of dull and lifeless films that try to fuse together these two storylines and make a complete hash out of it. \n\nThey lack the magic (pun intended) that  the original series had. Part of the blame goes to David Yates', who is definitely my least favourite director.

It's like when people say TERF Island or that trans people die in large numbers in the UK. It just doesn't hold up to scrutiny in a country that is largely lgtbq+ friendly. Moreso than 90% of other countries.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Rowling is a victim of sexual assault, this point always seems to get glossed over, given that fact her pushing for safe spaces is more understandable. She also very clearly made choices with her name because of misogyny and inequality of the sexes. She grew up in a society where women were treated unfairly and gender equality is obviously fragile and easily lost for her. This context is all important to understand why she is fearful of cis men dressing up as women and infringing on women's rights, even if that isn't a very likely outcome. The UK also has some particularly backward rape laws where women can't rape men. This has led to some theories of avoiding prosecution by changing gender while awaiting trial or cis male rapists trying to gain access to female prisoners.\n\nI don't particularly agree with J K on much at all and her views are clearly based on fear but I actually think the main object of her fear is cis men and given her experience you can see why someone in her position might worry. I find it a bit worrying other people can't see her as a victim more than some kind of monster. \n\nThe way this situation has been handled is an absolute disaster. Including suddenly deciding nonsense like goblins in the bank are Jewish for no reason whatsoever or that slavery is portrayed favourably. It feels like a bunch of kids who watched the films but never read the books, loved them, and now are rebelling against them.\n\nI've seen many trans people speak out about the label of TERF because it is too often used to mean a woman that doesn't hold the same views and often has nothing to do with feminism whatsoever. It often just feels like misogyny most of the time. \n\nIts the same with labelling ppl transphobes. You solve nothing by doing that unless you try to understand why people hold those irrational fears and then show them another point of view The vitriol and gloating she's received were never going to result in anything other than more entrenched views. Being uncaring to a victim of sexual assault about her fears surrounding sexual assault is not a good look. \n\nThis strategy is causing far more harm to the trans community in the long term. People should just stick to facts, not exaggerate so much (e.g. Trans ppl aren't dying left, right and centre in the UK) and allow a bit more room for people to express an inaccurate view and learn from it, as well as admitting that we still don't know all the answers about a relatively recent phenomenon.

Consuming anything involving oil and all the bad things those companies are involved in, Chinese products, palm oil products, products from all sorts of companies involved in deforestation. \n\nThere's an enormous list of stuff that we all give money to because its pretty damn hard not to without living in a box, but still very little of it is actually necessary. We all tacitly accept and support oppression somewhere in our choices, and arguably in worse ways than giving a bit more money to an already multi billionaire who's a horrible transphobe, but at least isn't keeping people in literal slavery or destroying the planet. \n\nJK Rowling is a twat, and I totally get people wanting to boycott HP stuff over it. Personally I haven't really been involved with it since about the time HBP came out in cinema, but its not *impossible* for people to square enjoying something important to them or that brings them a lot of joy with the fact that it means kicking a bit of money to Rowling.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 22, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v4pdb1/harry_potter_fandom_jk_rowling_and_the_terfed/ib5mbug/"}, "ib7a5sx": {"Author": "robertobaggio20", "Parent ID": "t1_ib5goj2", "Body": "I'd literally have to throw away all my best books if this were my approach, especially if I included dead authors.

{"Title": "[Ejection Systems] \"What does this thing actually do?!\"", "Author": "ACES_II", "Subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "Body": "This is less about a hobby, and more about a VERY small career field.\n\n**The Background**\n\nIn the military, there’s no such thing as a regular old aircraft mechanic. The days of a pilot landing his fighter and being greeted by the sole mechanic who fixes the whole thing are long gone. Modern military aircraft are so complex that they require a multitude of different mechanical specialties to keep them in flyable condition. There are fuel system mechanics, hydraulic mechanics, engine mechanics, avionics mechanics, there’s even a Wheel and Tire section. \n\nOne of the smallest specialties are the ejection systems mechanics, commonly called Egress. When I say small, I mean SMALL; the Air Force doesn’t have more than 1,200 Egress troops around the world, and that number includes the Reserves and Air National Guards. The reason is because the Air Force flies a lot of planes, but many don’t have ejection systems. They’re limited to fighters, bombers, and the U-2 spy plane for the same reason school buses don’t have seat belts; the bigger the aircraft, the more survivable the crash.\n\nAnyway, you also have specialties within the Egress specialty. Egress troops are defined by the airframes they’re qualified on. Some, like the A-10, are seen as easy to work. The others are in arguable order, in terms of difficulty, but everyone can agree that one of the top three most difficult planes to maintain for our system is the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nHopefully, you’re all keeping up. I tend to ramble on a bit about my job.\n\nNow, part of the reason for the difficulty is because the F-16s the Air Force has purchased are flying WAY past the established service life. We’re replacing parts that were never meant to be replaced. On top of all that, the Air Force has been upgrading the F-16 since the day the first one rolled off the assembly line in Fort Worth. Better avionics, more durable parts, all of it.\n\n**The Mass Confusion**\n\nOn F-16 canopies (the polyurethane bubble the pilot looks through, and the encompassing frame), there is a metal pin.\n\nIt’s made of steel. About half an inch long, pointing down, on the very bottom of the canopy frame. It also has an internal spring, which means that when the canopy closes, the pin is pushed up into a recessed pocket in the frame. It sticks out just forward of the canopy locking handle.\n\nAnd in the early-mid 2010’s (I think around 2014 or so), nobody had a damn clue what it did.\n\nI mean, we all knew it was there. We just didn’t know why. It did absolutely nothing, as far as we could tell. It wasn’t integral to the operation of the canopy. It just hit a metal disk on the frame, retracted in when the canopy closed, and popped back out when it opened. Nobody had any idea what it was there for.\n\nBut we had more important problems to deal with. And we were heavy believers in “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. So we left it alone.\n\nUntil we found a jet with the pin broken off. Missing items in a fighter plane cockpit are a Huge Fucking Deal ™. A tiny piece of metal in the wrong place can (and has in the past) cause a multi-million-dollar aircraft to crash. So when this pin was found broken off, a search was immediately launched in the cockpit to try and find it. Everything was torn out. Magnets, borescopes, handheld vacuum cleaners, every effort was made to try and find it.\n\nAnd then supervision started asking the uncomfortable question; “What IS this thing we’re looking for?”\n\nLiterally nobody had a clue.\n\nThe most experienced mechanic had no idea. He asked our shop chief, who’d been doing Egress work for sixteen years. He had no idea. HE called literally every F-16 base in the WORLD, trying to find out what this pin did. Nobody had a damn clue why F-16s had this mysterious pin.\n\nThe entire time this is happening, his phone is ringing off the hook. Senior NCOs want to know what this thing is. Now officers are calling to ask him. Our squadron commander showed up pissed, because the Colonel asked him what the pin did and he “had to stand and explain that he had no idea, like he’s some sort of blind asshole leading a bunch of other blind assholes”.\n\nRule #1: Don’t ever make the commander look stupid. \n\nRule #2: Don’t, under ANY circumstances, ever break Rule #1.\n\n**The Expert**\n\nWhile chaos is reigning, nobody has thought to ask the Expert.\n\nExpert is a civilian who works in our shop. He retired from the Air Force in the late nineties, then came back to work as a civilian contractor because he likes the job. He’s been working on planes longer than some of the other guys have been alive.\n\nHe also does not concern himself with what is happening in the shop chief's office. He’s there to work, not get involved with officers, whom he hates with a fiery passion. And he doesn’t know that three NCOs are tearing through technical data in a valiant effort to figure out what the hell this damn pin is there for.\n\nFinally, somebody realizes that the Expert is actually there. Happily and obliviously doing his own thing on a computer, answering emails, where one of the other guys is looking at an intact pin on another canopy. Said guy finally turned to the Expert, the first person to do so in the hours it’s been since the whole ordeal started.\n\n“Hey, Expert?”\n\nExpert lazily turns his chair, spitting a sunflower seed into a cup as he does so. He wipes his mouth on the collar of the work shirt he’s been wearing every day since 1998. “Yea?”\n\n“Do you know what this pin here is for?”\n\nExpert tilts his head to see the pin the NCO is pointing at.\n\n“Oh, sure. Back in the early eighties, there used to be a sensor in the cockpit that turned on a light to tell the pilot that the canopy was fully down. That pin was the thing that used to activate it.”\n\n“It did?!”\n\n“Yea.” He looks up in thought. “They ditched it back in eighty-four, I think. Replaced it with the sensors that lit up when the hooks fully rotated.”\n\n“Then why is the pin still here?!”\n\n“It’s built into the frame. Can’t be removed.” Expert shrugged. “They just plugged the hole where the sensor was, and called it a day. Why do you ask?”\n\nFour hours, we’d been trying to figure it out. Hell, people around the world had been trying. Facebook messages had been sent to guys in Germany, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Qatar. And nobody had ever thought to ask the Expert, because everyone had just assumed that someone else already had.\n\nThe search was called off after another hour. The missing pin was never found. Within twenty-four hours, we had engineer approval to take a pair of metal cutters to every F-16 on the ramp and snip off all the pins.", "ID": "l95szs", "Score": 10188, "Ratio": 0.99, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/l95szs/ejection_systems_what_does_this_thing_actually_do/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/l95szs/ejection_systems_what_does_this_thing_actually_do/", "Number of comments": 274, "Comments": {"glgsb9y": {"Author": "Agnol117", "Parent ID": "t3_l95szs", "Body": "> “It’s built into the frame.

A few years back (I wanna say around 2013), it was discovered that our registers had a security flaw -- namely, that the key used to open the register from the outside was universal, and therefore would work at any location to open the registers (this was, of course, not discovered until after someone had stolen a bunch from the registers). The solution? Superglue a penny over the keyhole. Cheaper and faster than replacing every register drawer. And the kicker?

There have been many examples of magos who actually understand their technology even if it is couched in religious terms. Once you translate the religious terms to modern technical jargon, you realise that they actually show a deep understanding of their tech. Furthermore there are many depictions of magos as actual scientist-priests who are invested in advancing humanity's knowledge. Of course in the real world while the consequences of pursuing an ultimately unsuccessful avenue of research may be that you wasted a grant, in 40k a sub-sector was just destroyed because you used resources on research instead of producing lasguns,  billions of lives have been lost, and oh your research happened to end up summoning daemons. I can't say for others, but after learning more about the Mechanicus and their history I came to appreciate them at least partially as the desperate keepers of humanity's knowledge in a universe where all has been lost.\n\nThe Priests of Mars series is very good for a more different look on the Mechanicus.

{"Title": "[Independent Comic Books] The Cerebus Effect: How one of the most acclaimed comic books in the industry lost 80% of its audience with a bizarre rant about feminism", "Author": "IHad360K_KarmaDammit", "Subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "Body": "To start off with, I've never actually read Cerebus; I've just read *about* it (along with bits and pieces of the comic itself) in order to make this post. So let me know if I get anything wrong. A while ago, I read a reference to \"The Cerebus Effect\", a term for an initially goofy work (like a TV show or comic) that gradually becomes more serious. Curious about the name, I looked it up and discovered that [Cerebus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Cerebus112and113.jpg) was, according to Wikipedia, a critically acclaimed, well-written comic book that ran for 27 years, cited as a major influence on many other comics, including some I had read. Why had I never heard of it before? Why isn't it better known, if it's so influential? Why isn't there already a Netflix series in the works, coming Spring 2022? Well, it turns out there is a *damn* good reason for that, but first, some background.\n\n# In the beginning...\n\nCerebus was the creation of Dave Sim, a Canadian cartoonist who was 21 when he started writing and drawing the comic in 1977. At first, Cerebus (which started as a misspelling of \"Cerberus\") was a parody of Conan the Barbarian, with the main difference being that [the main character was an aardvark](https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/20171225090138/WEB_Cerebus_01.jpg). Along with his wife, Deni Loubert, Sim ran his own publishing house, Aardvark-Vanaheim, allowing him to write without the constraints most publishers would have put on his work.\n\nAfter 25 issues, Sim decided to work on a longer, more serious storyline and declared everything before that to be Book 1, with the next 25 issues making up Book 2: High Society. Sales started picking up, and DC Comics offered Sim $100,000 for the rights to Cerebus. Sim refused, and went on to make $150,000 on sales of the collected version of High Society. He also decided that Cerebus would have a single, overarching story, ending with the death of the main character in issue #300. (This was shortly after he did a large amount of LSD, which tells you a lot about Sim's creative process.)\n\nThroughout the next several books, Sim's readership continued to grow, as did his critical acclaim. He brought an assistant on board to do the backgrounds for the panels, giving him more time to draw the characters and write. Cerebus went from a barbarian adventurer to a politician and the Pope, and other characters who had started out relatively one-dimensional grew more and more complex. It was, by all accounts, a really, *really* good comic, dealing with issues of religion, politics and philosophy while still remaining funny and starring a protagonist who looked like a Sonic the Hedgehog side character. Although some readers were displeased by the less goofy, more serious style (and the way Cerebus went from a funny antihero to [a genuinely awful person](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EJKZhfxYMLw/UeJhmE89JNI/AAAAAAAAKBQ/GntxWROivxA/s1600/cerebus_066_throwing_babies2.jpg)), the popularity of the comic exploded, and as of issue #100, sold 36,000 copies. Without the backing of a major company like Marvel or DC, that was unheard of, and Sim's success inspired other independent cartoonists, including Jeff Smith, the creator of Bone. The art for the comic was also incredibly and consistently inventive, bringing in more and more fans. Although the independent comics industry shrank by the late 1980's, Sim managed to keep circulation around 25,000 and Cerebus was just as influential as ever.\n\nAnd then he decided to flush it all down the toilet.\n\n# Issue #186\n\nAfter the success of the storylines \"Jaka's Story\" and \"Melmoth\", both of which focused on side characters rather than Cerebus, Sim returned him to center stage with \"Mothers and Daughters\". By this point, Sim also broke the fourth wall on a regular basis, and had introduced a character named Viktor Davis who served as an in-universe author avatar. In Issue 186, published in 1994, the comic was interrupted for a long wall of text (narrated by Viktor Davis but clearly representing Sim's own thoughts) about how men are rational, dispassionate creators of civilization, women are weak, emotional and destructive, and \"the Emotional Female Void devours what is left of the civilization which has been built by the Rational Male Light\". If you just want a quote that sums it up pretty well:\n\n\"Emotion, whatever the Female Void would have you believe, is not a more Exalted State than is Thought. In point of fact, I think Emotion is animalistic, serpent-brain stuff. Animals do not Think, but I am reasonably certain that they have Emotions. 'Eating this makes me Happy.' 'When my fur is all wet and I am cold, it makes me Sad.\" \"Ooo! Puppies!'   'It makes me Excited to Chase the Ball!' Reason, as any husband can tell you, doesn't stand a chance in an argument with Emotion... this was the fundamental reason, I believe, that women were denied the vote for so long.\"\n\nThe whole thing is [here](http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/sim.html). It's probably worth noting that he'd gotten a divorce in the 80's, although you could probably guess that already.\n\n[According to Jeff Smith](https://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/interviews/2257), Dave Sim visited him before publishing #186 and sat on his couch for two hours, telling Smith and his wife Vijaya about this brilliant anti-feminist idea he'd just had until Smith told him to shut up and threatened to punch him. The reaction from many of Sim's readers was much the same; many other cartoonists insisted he must be joking, or blamed all the drugs Sim had taken back in the 70's. The Comics Journal, a magazine about comic books, published [a drawing of him as a concentration camp guard](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbferoQtis1qh7juco1_1280.jpg) with \"Aardvark-Vanaheim\" in place of \"Arbeit macht frei\".\n\nWhatever else you think of Dave Sim, he certainly wasn't a sellout. Although that issue tanked his reputation, he made no attempt to walk it back, and the rest of Cerebus continued despite plummeting sales. He continued to insist that a homosexual/feminist/Marxist axis was the reason his comics weren't seen as the height of modern literature. Throughout the last 100 issues, Dave Sim converted to his own homebrew religion featuring aspects of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, in which the differences between the three religions are brought about by a Satanic, female figure called Yoowhoo who acts in opposition to the male God. Cerebus turned into a religious tract and continued to drop readers; Sim did finish the series at 300 issues, but he only sold 7,000 copies of the final one, a fraction of his previous readership.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nCerebus no longer has nearly the sort of fandom it once did, and those who do remember it are torn between the ones who think Sim was, while brilliantly talented, also completely nuts, and those true believers who continued to buy into the philosophy of Cerebus's later issues. If you want a slapfight about Dave's legacy, here's [732 comments on a post about him considering whether or not to let a particular publisher reprint Cerebus](http://www.tcj.com/dave-sim-responds-to-the-fantagraphics-offer/). Dave also started [a petition](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4PHWMEG9m_s/TuDztbRbYaI/AAAAAAAAATA/y3OImUs4OkE/s1600/letter_petition.gif) to get signatures from people agreeing that he isn't a misogynist, and refused to communicate with anyone who wouldn't sign it. (As of 2017, it has just under 2,000 signatures, which isn't bad considering...everything.)\n\nHe also gave [an interview with the AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/dave-sim-1798208330) just after finishing the final issue, which gives us this unintentionally hilarious conversation:\n\n>**O: Are there parts of your story that you would still like to address, or perspectives that you feel you haven't yet had the chance to get across?**  \n>  \n>**DS:** Ever the oblique leftist. I don't \"feel.\" If I \"felt,\" I would never have gotten the book done. I'd be off \"feeling\" somewhere. My best intellectual assessment of the completed work is that I said exactly what I wanted to say, exactly the way I wanted to say it. What you want to know is if I'm going to continue to attack feminism, and what sort of artillery I have left. I have a lot of artillery left. My best guess would be that I emptied one metaphorical clip from one metaphorical AK-47, mostly firing over your heads and at the ground, although most of you are feeling as if I dropped an atomic bomb on your house on Christmas morning.\n\nIt's worth reiterating: none of this was a joke. Dave Sim was, by all accounts, completely serious about everything he said. Apparently, he has now sold most of his furniture and donated the money as an act of religious asceticism, and communicates with the outside world mostly through letters back and forth with a guy who runs a Cerebus fan blog. Although Cerebus had an enormous influence on independent comic books, it's now forgotten or loathed outside of a small, loyal group of Dave Sim fans, and Dave seems to have no desire to change this.", "ID": "llg1se", "Score": 9187, "Ratio": 0.97, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/", "Number of comments": 785, "Comments": {"go2c6mv": {"Author": "sand500", "Parent ID": "t3_llg1se", "Body": "Locked due to large amount of reports", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 1, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/go2c6mv/"}, "gnpgfjz": {"Author": "Deleted", "Parent ID": "t3_llg1se", "Body": "“Ever the oblique leftist” has such meme potential.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 2859, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/gnpgfjz/"}, "gnph4wy": {"Author": "11twofour", "Parent ID": "t3_llg1se", "Body": "These guys never get that anger is an emotion.\n\n\nEdit: holy shit this AV Club interview is unhinged.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 1841, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/gnph4wy/"}, "gnrr1y7": {"Author": "SamTom79", "Parent ID": "t3_llg1se", "Body": "Hard to imagine why his wife left him.\n\n\"Honey, what do you want for dinner?\"\n\n\"I don't 'want.'

I came across one with a sign that offered free comics if I gave them my email. Sounded pretty good because I like free, so I signed up on what I thought was a mailing list, and so did my gf. We were both handed a stack of 5-6 Cerebus comics. I had never heard of it, but it was free so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nWent home, and over the next couple weeks I read the comics. They were ok, but they were just random single issues, so I couldn't follow any of the storyline. Then a little later I noticed in my email inbox that I had an email confirming that I had signed an online petition. This was odd because I had done no such thing, so I clicked it.\n\nI read then petition and let out an audible \"what the fuck?\", because apparently I had signed a petition stating that Dave Sim was *not* a misogynist. I was confused because I had no idea who the fuck that was, and neither did my gf, so I did a quick Google search. I saw that he was the author of Cerebus, and quickly (ok, maybe it wasn't so quick) put it together that he had used my email I gave him to sign the petition for me without my knowledge. I honestly thought it was just funny because it was so fucking *weird*.\n\nI figured the people who run the comic con wouldn't be happy about it though, because it could look like they were allowing it since they allowed the guy to rent a booth. So I sent them an email telling them about what happened. They thanked me for the info, said it definitely was done without their knowledge, and told me that the guy working the booth and Dave Sim would be forever banned from our small Comic Con.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 509, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/llg1se/independent_comic_books_the_cerebus_effect_how/gnqozet/"}, "gnprzc7": {"Author": "JoeXM", "Parent ID": "t3_llg1se", "Body": "You guys should be glad you're reading it in 'phonebooks' and not the original issues.

I bought every phone book that had been published to that point. I took one of them to a comic convention and got it signed by Sim and Gerhard, Sim even doing a quick sketch of Lord Julius on the title page for me at no charge.\n\n\"Jaka's Story\" was amazing, a beautiful story of a lonely rich girl. After that, it started going downhill. One of the collections that followed - about half the length of the previous books - was a retelling of the last days of Oscar Wilde. When this came out I thought it a pointless and over-long digression from the main storyline, but trusted that the story would pick back up once he returned to the main characters in the next book.\n\nBut that didn't happen, for reasons OP pointed out - Sim was descending into madness and misogyny then, and subsequent volumes were worse and worse.\n\nYet I continued to buy them. I'd invested a few hundred dollars into the series, collecting all the phone books plus a number of individual special issues (like \"Cerebus Zero\", which reprinted some one-shot comics that occurred between the stories in the phone books).\n\nBy the time of \"Rick's Story\", it became very clear that the Cerebus I knew was dead and gone. As the series wrapped up, I bought the last few books just in the interest of \"completeness\", thinking it a shame to collect 90% of a decades-long run and ignore the last part. The final volume, \"The Last Day\", was predictably dreadful, but at least I could say I stuck it out. I spent all of ten minutes skimming through it then put it on the shelf with the rest, never to be read again.\n\nI ended up selling the entire lot on Ebay when I moved between cities a few years ago, for less than I'd paid for it originally.

Dave Sim, on the other hand, has absolutely none of that knowledge or charity and solipsizes the hell out of anything that even flickers across his attention.

{"Title": "[Home Crafting] When a company tried to make a bunch of stay at home moms pay rent to use a machine they already own during a global pandemic", "Author": "benmacklemost", "Subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "Body": "All across America there are women who are mostly stay at home moms who consider themselves crafters. They make items like custom t-shirts for their family reunions, \"Live Laugh Love\" alcohol paintings to decorate their houses, and personalized water bottles or tumblers for every child on their kid's cheer team. There is an entire YouTube world out there of women with home crafting rooms showing other women how to cut, paint, and dye every conceivable object into a piece of homemade art. Additionally, there are a number of these crafters who make personalized gifts and sell them on places like Etsy, so part of their income is dependent on their tools working well and at scale.\n\nOne of the important tools of the trade for these women are vinyl cutting machines. They are about 18in x 6in x 6in machines that go on your desktop much like a printer does. They are basically an industrial sign cutting tool or CNC machine scaled down for the needs of home crafters. A cutting machine consists of a cutting mat and a blade that will cut your material on the cutting mat into intricate shapes. These materials must be very thin, such as paper, vinyl, and potentially fabric. (Vinyl is a rubbery paper that can be stuck onto almost anything or heat pressed onto fabric.) These machines has exploded in popularity in the last 10 years and are sold in stores such as JoAnns, Michaels, and Hobby Lobby.\n\nOne of the most popular brands of vinyl cutting machines are Cricuts (pronounced cricket) owned by Provo Craft and Novelty Inc. Cricut has a small range of machines, the cheapest of which is $180. To use a Cricut you have to connect the machine to your computer and use their proprietary software. You upload your design to this software, clean it and adjust it, and then send it to the machine to begin cutting. The software is completely cloud-based, so you must have reliable internet access to use the cutting machine. There is a subscription service for $10 a month that is completely optional and gives you access to a design library of images and words that you can cut if you aren't making all your own designs or purchasing them from somewhere else.\n\nA little under a month ago Cricut made the announcement that it was going to be limiting its users to 20 uploads a month unless they are part of the $10 a month subscription plan. This means that a crafter can at most cut 20 designs out every month if they are making the designs themselves. To make this even worse, the software doesn't always work well, so one design often has to be uploaded multiple times in order to get it to a cuttable version. Since the software is cloud based and Cricut has sued third party software creators before, there doesn't seem to be a hack to get around this. Unless, of course, the crafter is willing to pay an additional $120 a year ($96 dollars a year if paid annually) to have unlimited use of a machine they already shelled out at least $180 for.\n\nTo put this in comparison, this is as if a printer that you already purchased and was in your house was suddenly only allowed to print 20 pages a month unless you paid the printer company a monthly usage fee.\n\nThe response to this was swift and vocal. Over 60,000 people signed a petition rejecting this change. People cancelled their subscription service to the design library. Refunds were demanded. Their social media pages blew up with negative comments. The company was sworn off forever by many who pledged to only purchase from their major competitor from now on. Speculation was made that this was Provo's attempt to improve their upcoming IPO.\n\nProvo heard the outcry. A few days later they released a statement that they would be keeping the current policy of unlimited uploads in place for anyone who purchased a machine before the end of this calendar year. That meant all current Cricut owners would be exempted from this policy forever.\n\nThis was not good enough. Why purchase a Cricut when its competitors make an equally good machine that doesn't have a $96 dollar a year usage fee? Crafters were still not pleased.\n\nSo Provo had to walk back their statements again. They decided to do away with the usage fee idea entirely. Every statement in the previous announcement referencing the end of the year was literally crossed out in their apology post (check it out: [https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/](https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/)).\n\nVictory for crafters everywhere! However, it seems the damage has been done. Cricut has broken trust with its users and many will probably remember this when it comes time for them to upgrade their current machines. Provo could have saved themselves a lot of grief by being a little less greedy about their IPO and a little more thoughtful about their optics.", "ID": "mmmcy7", "Score": 8648, "Ratio": 0.98, "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/", "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/", "Number of comments": 627, "Comments": {"gtsajdh": {"Author": "Deleted", "Parent ID": "t3_mmmcy7", "Body": "[deleted]", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 3110, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtsajdh/"}, "gtsanq4": {"Author": "Izanagi3462", "Parent ID": "t3_mmmcy7", "Body": "Eesh, I've seen companies do stupid stuff before, but this is a whole new level of \"give us more money\".

So, I’m someone who knows a lot about precision paper cutting tools. I used to design pattern blocking software for large scale systems, and as a result I spent a lot of time looking at machine specs for systems like the Cricut. Companies like this face a nasty series of decisions. You have a lot to consider with blade cutting as knives get dull and break, when the software fails it fails hard and that users are typically not savvy with complex technologies. As a result, sustainable business practices are hard to hash out. \n\nI specifically avoided Cricut, as did a number of people in my field. When cutting patterns you’ll sometimes do three to five iterations of the same block before coming to a final conclusion. In testing the Cricut did not hold up over time, as blades would dull, which can fail to fully cut, or worse tear the material. Believe it or not, crafters often cut at similar rates to a patterner, so my guess is that the company was having trouble maintaining viability. The membership system was probably a way to make products margins less thin, and offer some breathing room.\n\nI think this was less about greed and more about turning the difficulty down on this category of machine fabrication.

At it's root, this process is being driven by pressure from Wall Street and the achievement-oriented psychology of business executives. At the end of the day, customers do not matter in this equation.\n\nLonger Version:\n\nPrediction: This ain't over, not by a long shot. Cricut subscriptions of this nature will be back eventually, but will be attached to a new model sold at a loss. It will be just different enough to be considered a different product. It will be marketed to a younger demographic more accustomed to paying subscription fees for everything.  Once Cricut does it, Silhouette will do it, too, or vice-versa. The pressure will be too intense to resist. \n\nCricut *was* being thoughtful about their optics. They just weren't concerned with the optics as viewed by the customer. \n\nThis decision was driven by the optics as viewed by Wall Street. The street likes sticky money because sticky money is reliable. Subscription money is sticky, and will net Cricut the type of attention executives want from Wall Street, and not just short-term for an IPO. This would be an ongoing thing, which would enable much higher executive compensation while also making Cricut a more tempting target for future acquisition. That would be a big payout for execs and shareholders, too. Much bigger than an IPO.\n\nSo, so much of what drives business executives (and the affections of Wall Street analysts) is being part of the \"right\" group, one of the cool kids so to speak. Right now the cool kids in the world of business are tech companies, so lots of companies are doing everything they possibly can to turn themselves into a tech company (see: WeWork), but definitely NOT the type of tech company that primarily sells boring things like hardware. Hardware revenue isn't sticky because it only happens once. Any company that primarily sells hardware (like Cricut) is furiously paddling it's little duck feet under the water to make their hardware company appear to be a subscription-based software (SaaS) company.\n\nBusiness leaders are over-achievers, and this is why the customers must fall by the wayside. High-achievers tend to be anxious and eagerly seek approval. Some are driven by narcissism, which is also rooted in fear and perceptions of relative status. Regardless, for business leaders achievement is king. Sadly, a good customer sat number ranks low on the ladder of potential achievements. Customer sat only becomes a true priority when it gets in the way of the real achievements, which are usually more directly related to revenue goals and/or the current preferences of Wall Street. \n\nCustomers are not the gatekeepers to achievement. The gatekeepers to achievement are *other overachievers* in industry, finance, politics, philanthropy, or academia. Customers cannot grant these individuals the psychological sustenance they so desperately need, so the needs of the customer will *never* take precedence. Not for long, anyway.\n\nCustomers and their desires are beside the point. They're a means to an end.\n\nWhy do I think this?

I personally find Cricut overpriced when you can buy larger/longer sheets of vinyl from other stores for less than what we sell (& the ones we sell are shorter too, running at about $12.99 for 24\" in length). Not to mention the fact that you literally can never use coupons on them except for once in a blue moon. \n\nAlso, to add onto how greedy they are, they recently released a new mug press. The catch? The only mugs that will work in it are the Cricut mugs they make.\n\nEdited for grammar/clarification.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 6, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtu5vs1/"}, "gtu6lnd": {"Author": "K1ng0fhartsTTV", "Parent ID": "t3_mmmcy7", "Body": "As a gamer, this doesn't seem TOO far off from what Sony did with Playstation.

Glad to see that consumers won out on this one.\n\nA lot of these companies aren't learning the secret to stuff like this. You don't disable current features and then force people to pay. That's a recipe for disaster. The trick is to introduce new (subscription-based) features that are so good, it's pointless to be a customer without them. \n\nA great example are how theme parks have shifted. When I was a kid, there were no fast passes. You'd go and stand in line until it was your turn. My family went to six flags and cedar point every single summer when I was growing up, and all we'd pay for was our pass to get into the park. A couple of years ago I went back to cedar point for the first time in 15 years or so. Didn't think the fast pass was worth the money. Boy was I wrong. EVERYBODY had fast pass, so not only was it considerably longer to get on rides, you'd often find yourself moving BACKWARDS in the line as everybody else moved past you. Rides that had maybe a 45 minute line when I was a kid, were now 4-5 HOURS to get on without the fast pass. They were very smart about this method of milking more money from people.

The basic software is free and you can upgrade to add more features, there’s also a license key you can buy to cut directly from Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, and there’s a mobile app. The only sub i see from them is if you want to access their design library but if you make everything yourself, it’s not necessary. But i mostly got it because the Silhouette blade can cut at multiple depths on one pass, which saves time on making things like sticker sheets. However ive seen the Brother Scan & Cut go around and its a heftier price however the cutting software is in the machine itself instead of having to do everything in a computer first.

Problematically, the emissions-control modules (both hardware and software for this) are finnicky and tend to freeze up or brick the tractor for filter issues and even just regular, freezing temperatures (you know, the kind of thing that obviously *never* happens in states like Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, the Dakotas, or Ohio), so this tends to happen when crops desperately need to be harvested immediately before large crop losses.\n\nAnyway, JD says that farmers will delete their tractors’ emissions-control modules and tune up the horsepower, which are actually both pretty valid fears since farmers’ representative groups don’t even bother to deny that the farmers like to do like to do these things via gray-market software and hardware suppliers and technicians, but to prevent this, JD has refused to sell the farmers the repair and diagnostic software that the JD technicians use. This has led to a major cost to farmers due to situations where they did nothing wrong and a problem with the software forced them to pay out the wazoo for a JD tech to come fix their tractor while the farmer lost crops and critical time.\n\nOn the other hand, the farmers are openly saying “well why can’t we just log in and dial up the horsepower? Screw the emissions standard,” which doesn’t exactly help the cause since it roughly amounts to intellectual property fraud because JD already sells a tractor at that horsepower, but one that passes the emissions standards.\n\nOn top of this, the Nebraska Farm Bureau has now twice voted for a right-to-repair bill and been slapped down by the state legislature due to fears of, and I’m not joking here, the Big Tractor lobby.", "Text Url": [["No title found", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-05/farmers-fight-john-deere-over-who-gets-to-fix-an-800-000-tractor)"]], "Ups": 25, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtu0945/"}, "gtsvabf": {"Author": "Troodon79", "Parent ID": "t1_gtslq54", "Body": "To my knowledge, John Deere insists when you buy a tractor, you're purchasing hardware and RENTING the software, so if you don't pony up and never take it to any dealer other than a licensed JD mechanic, it won't work.\n\nDon't quote me on that, though.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 36, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtsvabf/"}, "gttbt73": {"Author": "nymvaline", "Parent ID": "t1_gtslq54", "Body": "I think the theory is that you have to be able to retain control of the software in order to make sure the tractors/etc continue to meet environmental emissions regulations.

Started with the portrait, got the Cameo when it came out, then upgraded to the Cameo 3. My mom and SIL both went for Cricut machines and I am very happy with my choice. \n\nI will caution that the Silhouette hardware itself seems not as good as the Cricut. There are a few small pieces (the rollers, the lever that raises the rollers, etc) that are easy to break or get gunked up if you don’t take care of it. I was careless with my machines (hence, why I needed to upgrade)\n\nThe silhouette software, however, vastly makes up for the hardware cons. First of all, the Cricut software is web-based, which I hate when trying to do graphic design. The silhouette software has many similar features to Adobe Illustrator or GIMP, so if you’re at all familiar with those, the Cricut software will drive you nuts (it’s limited and the terminology is often the opposite of GIMP/Adobe). I ended up upgrading the Silhouette software to the Business edition (for a one-time fee) to unlock more features, but the basic/free software was great for my first few years of cutting! (I upgraded because I wanted to use the embossing feature and the auto-weed feature, which makes cut lines around your project to easily weed the excess). \n\nIt can also be harder to find Silhouette blades, mats, etc. due to Cricut being the major brand sold at JoAnn’s, Michael’s, etc. but the only tome I really had issues buying a replacement blade was at the beginning of the Pandemic, when everyone was having supply issues. \n\nOverall, I will ALWAYS recommend Silhouette over Cricut. If you’re not great at software, it might be a steeper learning curve, but it’s worth it IMO.\n\nEdited to add to wait for Mother’s Day: I bought the Cameo 3 last year in a bundle sale on Mother’s Day (directly from SilhouetteAmerica.com) that came with extra blades, mats, pens, vinyl, and a bunch of cool stuff for the same price the machine itself cost.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 13, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtu1yz5/"}, "gtunjxy": {"Author": "geenersaurus", "Parent ID": "t1_gttioei", "Body": "any printer will work as long as it can print at a high enough quality, i have a photo printer and it works for me for now and i use a weatherproof vinyl from onlinelabels.com that’s made to work with inkjet printers. you can add more protection with laminate overlays but home cut stickers will never be as truly quality as getting them done by a company that specializes in vinyl printing like stickerapp. The way both cricut and silhouette work is by using registration marks printed on the paper which can be tricky especially in low light conditions", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 2, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtunjxy/"}, "gtwopb4": {"Author": "geenersaurus", "Parent ID": "t1_gtw3qzb", "Body": "as far as i know it does although i have never tried it myself. you may have to put an interfacing on it and on the cutting mat but the official site says it can.

I used Photoshop because they had a subscription of, like 10 dollars at the time here where I live, and kept the price low for 2 or 3 years, but only for Photoshop and Lightroom, so I didn't even tried Adobe Illustrator.\n\nPen and brush tools from Photoshop are very inadequate when you're doing sharp brush strokes for things like comic drawings. The brushes takes RAW input from the tablet device, so if your hand jitters, it shows in the picture. But when you use Clip Studio Paint, it has more options to make the line smoothier, like post-processing the stroke to reduce the number of points and stabilizing the stroke so the points are more in an average curve. If your hands shake, it will not show up on the drawing.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is that a more proper tool for the job will have more specific features too. Clip Studio Paint has the vector layer where every brush becomes a vector brush. It cannot be used to make a shape to fill collors like you would expect in programs like Illustrator, it's only for line art, but allows you to edit the brush stroke after you have done it. You can drag and twist and rotate all you want and in the end it will look pixel perfect. And you can always make vector curves that work like \"rulers\", path for the brush strokes to travel on, so if you're having trouble with drawing a curve, you can just say \"fuck it\", make a ruler for the curve with the shape you need and it will let you brush follow that path with no effort. Photoshop simply has none of these stuff.\n\nSince CSP was made for japanese manga artists first, it has all sorts of functions for drawing actual comics too. Baloon tools, frame tools, halftones, filling selected areas with materials, using 3D models to draw on top, etc. You start realizing that Photoshop was never really intended for this job, which makes it easier to ditch that pesky monthly subscription.\n\nSo, if you use Adobe Photoshop or any other that depends on that subscription fee, checking for alternative may pay off big time depending on what you do, even if paying is not an issue. :P", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 11, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtwx6se/"}, "gtwhzf6": {"Author": "CorbenikTheRebirth", "Parent ID": "t1_gtw52vy", "Body": "Gimp is okay for basic stuff, but in terms of features, interface, and usability, it really is miles behind the competition.", "Text Url": [], "Ups": 10, "Downs": 0, "Permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/mmmcy7/home_crafting_when_a_company_tried_to_make_a/gtwhzf6/"}, "gtwlb85": {"Author": "CapMcCloud", "Parent ID": "t1_gtw52vy", "Body": "Gimp can’t do a quarter of the shit Photoshop can.

I taught for a long time in public schools and now I teach college students to be music teachers.\n\nWhen I was teaching in schools, curriculum would come in books, with accompanying CDs or music downloads. You can also buy tons of additional material to supplement your curriculum, depending on what your students like, what they need extra help with,  etc. Every seven-ten years, the district/state would purchase new curriculum and I used it, but also still had the old curriculum so I could use things from it that students really liked, that were particularly fun or interesting, or whatever. \n\nMy school usually bought curriculum and I bought supplementary materials--anything I bought i could take with me when I moved schools or when I left K12 for higher ed. That worked out nice at the college level because often (pre-pandemic) my students could come to my office and browse my bookshelves to get lesson ideas, or I could loan a book out to a student or to a colleague. I can also tell the university library to buy different books and actually we have a \"resource room\" full of curriculum materials students can browse. Our student teachers use it and sometimes even their mentor teachers do too. So my students benefit and so do the students they are teaching.\n\nPoint being, either I or the school *owned* it.

Their big selling point is that the curriculum is \"customizable\" and that teachers can build their own lessons inside Quaver, which is nice, but as soon as you stop paying the subscription you lose not only their materials but all the materials you created in Quaver. Poof, gone. If you change schools or districts, even if they all have Quaver, then you lose that stuff too (from what I've been told by teachers, I have not experienced this myself).
